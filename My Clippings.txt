Tell me something: Why is taste, the crudest of our senses, exempted from the ethical rules that govern our other senses? If you stop and think about it, it’s crazy. Why doesn’t a horny person have as strong a claim to raping an animal as a hungry one does to killing and eating it? It’s easy to dismiss that question but hard to respond to it. And how would you judge an artist who mutilated animals in a gallery because it was visually arresting? How riveting would the sound of a tortured animal need to be to make you want to hear it that badly? Try to imagine any end other than taste for which it would be justifiable to do what we do to farmed animals.

The USDA has a monopoly on the most important advertising space in the nation — those little nutritional boxes we find on virtually everything we eat. Founded the same year that the ADA opened its offices, the USDA was charged with providing nutritional information to the nation and ultimately with creating guidelines that would serve public health. At the same time, though, the USDA was charged with promoting industry.

If contributing to the suffering of billions of animals that live miserable lives and (quite often) die in horrific ways isn’t motivating, what would be? If being the number one contributor to the most serious threat facing the planet (global warming) isn’t enough, what is?

First, the experience usually occurs when we confront tasks we have a chance of completing. Second, we must be able to concentrate on what we are doing. Third and fourth, the concentration is usually possible because the task undertaken has clear goals and provides immediate feedback. Fifth, one acts with a deep but effortless involvement that removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life. Sixth, enjoyable experiences allow people to exercise a sense of control over their actions. Seventh, concern for the self disappears, yet paradoxically the sense of self emerges stronger after the flow experience is over. Finally, the sense of the duration of time is altered; hours pass by in minutes, and minutes can stretch out to seem like hours.

what people enjoy is not the sense of being in control, but the sense of exercising control in difficult situations. It is not possible to experience a feeling of control unless one is willing to give up the safety of protective routines. Only when a doubtful outcome is at stake, and one is able to influence that outcome, can a person really know whether she is in control.

So much of what we ordinarily do has no value in itself, and we do it only because we have to do it, or because we expect some future benefit from it. Many people feel that the time they spend at work is essentially wasted—they are alienated from it, and the psychic energy invested in the job does nothing to strengthen their self.

The family context promoting optimal experience could be described as having five characteristics. The first one is clarity: the teenagers feel that they know what their parents expect from them—goals and feedback in the family interaction are unambiguous. The second is centering, or the children’s perception that their parents are interested in what they are doing in the present, in their concrete feelings and experiences, rather than being preoccupied with whether they will be getting into a good college or obtaining a well-paying job. Next is the issue of choice: children feel that they have a variety of possibilities from which to choose, including that of breaking parental rules—as long as they are prepared to face the consequences. The fourth differentiating characteristic is commitment, or the trust that allows the child to feel comfortable enough to set aside the shield of his defenses, and become unselfconsciously involved in whatever he is interested in. And finally there is challenge, or the parents’ dedication to provide increasingly complex opportunities for action to their children.

Deprived of serious exposure to music, children grow into teenagers who make up for their early deprivation by investing inordinate amounts of psychic energy into their own music. They form rock groups, buy tapes and records, and generally become captives of a subculture that does not offer many opportunities for making consciousness more complex.

It seems, for instance, that the early hunter-gatherers, like their present-day descendants living in the inhospitable deserts of Africa and Australia, spent only three to five hours each day on what we would call working—providing for food, shelter, clothing, and tools. They spent the rest of the day in conversation, resting, or dancing.

In fact, some critics have emphasized the differences: while flow is the result of a conscious attempt to master challenges, Yu occurs when the individual gives up conscious mastery. In this sense they see flow as an example of the “Western” search for optimal experience, which according to them is based on changing objective conditions (e.g., by confronting challenges with skills), whereas Yu is an example of the “Eastern” approach, which disregards objective conditions entirely in favor of spiritual playfulness and the transcendence of actuality.

Some surgeons say that on the mornings before an important operation they put themselves on “automatic pilot” by eating the same breakfast, wearing the same clothes, and driving to the hospital by the same route. They do so not because they are superstitious, but because they sense that this habitual behavior makes it easier for them to devote their undivided attention to the challenge ahead.

For example, in one study we used the Experience Sampling Method to answer the question: Do people report more instances of flow at work or in leisure? The respondents, over a hundred men and women working full-time at a variety of occupations, wore an electronic pager for one week, and whenever the pager beeped in response to signals sent at eight random times each day for a week, they filled out two pages of a booklet to record what they were doing and how they felt at the moment they were signaled. Among other things, they were asked to indicate, on ten-point scales, how many challenges they saw at the moment, and how many skills they felt they were using. A person was counted as being in flow every time he or she marked both the level of challenges and the level of skills to be above the mean level for the week. In this particular study over 4,800 responses were collected—an average of about 44 per person per week. In terms of the criterion we had adopted, 33 percent of these responses were “in flow”—that is, above the mean personal weekly level of challenges and skills. Of course, this method of defining flow is rather liberal. If one only wished to include extremely complex flow experiences—say, those with the highest levels of challenges and skills—perhaps fewer than 1 percent of the responses would qualify as flow. The methodological convention adopted here to define flow functions somewhat like a microscope: depending on the level of magnification used, very different detail will be visible. As expected, the more time a person spent in flow during the week, the better was the overall quality of his or her reported experience. People who were more often in flow were especially likely to feel “strong,” “active,” “creative,” “concentrated,” and “motivated.” What was unexpected, however, is how frequently people reported flow situations at work, and how rarely in leisure.

What does this contradictory pattern mean? There are several possible explanations, but one conclusion seems inevitable: when it comes to work, people do not heed the evidence of their senses. They disregard the quality of immediate experience, and base their motivation instead on the strongly rooted cultural stereotype of what work is supposed to be like. They think of it as an imposition, a constraint, an infringement of their freedom, and therefore something to be avoided as much as possible. It could be argued that although flow at work is enjoyable, people cannot stand high levels of challenge all the time. They need to recover at home, to turn into couch potatoes for a few hours each day even though they don’t enjoy it. But comparative examples seem to contradict this argument. For instance the farmers of Pont Trentaz work much harder, and for longer hours, than the average American, and the challenges they face in their daily round require at least as high levels of concentration and involvement. Yet they don’t wish to be doing something else while working, and afterward, instead of relaxing, they fill their free time with demanding leisure activities. As these findings suggest, the apathy of many of the people around us is not due to their being physically or mentally exhausted. The problem seems to lie more in the modern worker’s relation to his job, with the way he perceives his goals in relation to it.

Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback, rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed. Hobbies that demand skill, habits that set goals and limits, personal interests, and especially inner discipline help to make leisure what it is supposed to be—a chance for re-creation.

Social science surveys have universally concluded that people claim to be most happy with friends and family, or just in the company of others. When they are asked to list pleasant activities that improve their mood for the entire day, the kind of events most often mentioned are “Being with happy people,” “Having people show interest in what I say,” “Being with friends,” and “Being noticed as sexually attractive.” One of the major symptoms that sets depressed and unhappy people apart is that they rarely report such events occurring to them. A supportive social network also mitigates stress: an illness or other misfortune is less likely to break a person down if he or she can rely on the emotional support of others.

When we can imagine only few opportunities and few possibilities, it is relatively easy to achieve harmony. Desires are simple, choices clear. There is little room for conflict and no need to compromise. This is the order of simple systems—order by default, as it were.

It’s the same with dating. You need to practice asking interesting questions, expressing yourself in a compelling way, and going in for a first kiss. Those are your reps. And you can’t work on any of these skills if you’re sitting around by yourself, “preparing.” The only way to get better at it is to actually date.

Finally, remember what we just learned about adaptation. Even if you marry the most attractive person, eventually, you’ll get used to how they look. That initial pleasure will fade. A big part of our sex drive is associated with novelty. So no matter how hot your partner is, it’s likely that your sexual interest in them will decrease over time, simply because they are no longer new to you. To paraphrase some Internet wisdom: “For every hot person, there is someone out there tired of having sex with them.” Infatuation fades! Lust fades! All that matters is that you feel attracted to the person, not that you scored the hottest possible person.

You can get a sense of how kind someone is by paying attention to how they treat people from whom they don’t need anything. Are they nice to the waiter? Do they give up their seat on the subway? Are they patient with new team members who are learning the ropes at work? Do they treat their friends and parents with compassion? One way to get a sense of someone’s emotional stability is to pay attention to how they respond to stressful situations. Do they freak out or keep their cool? Emotionally stable partners are measured in their responses. They take time to thoughtfully respond rather than impulsively react. When I explain this concept to my clients, I quote Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor and celebrated psychiatrist. He wrote: “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.” Someone who is emotionally stable takes advantage of that space.

One easy way to estimate someone’s loyalty is to see if they have friends from different stages of their lives. How many old friendships have they carried with them over the years? Did they ditch their college bestie when they got depressed, or do they still meet up for monthly movie matinees? Do people from their past seem to rely on them for companionship and support? Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, since some people have moved around a lot or lived in places where they didn’t fit in. But in general, old friendships indicate loyalty.

Yet current dating apps don’t let you search for any of those qualities. How could they? It’s hard enough to accurately measure personality traits, let alone what those traits would elicit in you. Instead, dating apps are limited by the information they can reliably capture and catalog: height, age, college, job, and how good someone is at selecting flattering pictures that make them look cool yet approachable, sexy but playful.

The same thing happens when people sign up for a dating app. Once people set app preferences during onboarding, they’re very unlikely to change them. The apps show us people who meet our initial criteria—the type of people we think we want. If you believe that you’d hate dating a woman who’s taller than you are, and the apps offer you only short women to choose from, you never get the chance to be proved wrong.

You can become a better conversationalist by learning to give support responses rather than shift responses. Sociologist Charles Derber identified a shift response as a moment in which you shift the focus of the conversation back to yourself. A support response, on the other hand, encourages the speaker to continue the story. For example, if your date says, “I’m going to Lake Michigan with my family in a few weeks,” a shift response would be: “Oh, I went there a few summers ago.” Even though, on the surface, you’re engaging with what your date has said, you’ve drawn the attention back to yourself. A support response might sound like “Have you been there before?” or “How did your family choose that location?” Support responses indicate that you’re invested in their story and want to hear more. They make your date feel appreciated and amplify the connection between the two of you.

A general rule in creating stories is that characters don’t want to change. They must be forced to change. Nobody wakes up and starts chasing a bad guy or dismantling a bomb unless something forces them to do so. The bad guys just robbed your house and are running off with your last roll of toilet paper, or the bomb is strapped to your favorite cat. It’s that sort of thing that gets a character moving.

And I found myself wanting even better stories. And that’s the thing you’ll realize when you organize your life into the structure of story. You’ll get a taste for one story and then want another, and then another, and the stories will build until you’re living a kind of epic of risk and reward, and the whole thing will be molding you into the actual character whose roles you’ve been playing. And once you live a good story, you get a taste for a kind of meaning in life, and you can’t go back to being normal; you can’t go back to meaningless scenes stitched together by the forgettable thread of wasted time. The more practice stories I lived, the more I wanted an epic to climb inside of and see through till its end.

Susan essentially said no. And she said that with her husband sitting right there in the audience. She said she and her husband believed they were a cherished prize for each other, and they would probably drive any other people mad. But then she said something I thought was wise. She said she had married a guy, and he was just a guy. He wasn’t going to make all her problems go away, because he was just a guy. And that freed her to really love him as a guy, not as an ultimate problem solver. And because her husband believed she was just a girl, he was free to really love her too. Neither needed the other to make everything okay. They were simply content to have good company through life’s conflicts. I thought that was beautiful.

I don’t ever want to go back to believing life is meaningless. I know there are biochemical causes for some forms of depression, but I wish people who struggle against dark thoughts would risk their hopes on living a good story—by that I mean finding a team of people doing hard work for a noble cause, and joining them. I think they’d be surprised at how soon their sad thoughts would dissipate, if for no other reason than they didn’t have time to think them anymore.

Such a stressor would be certainly better than the mild but continuous stress of a boss, mortgage, tax problems, guilt over procrastinating with one’s tax return, exam pressures, chores, emails to answer, forms to complete, daily commutes—things that make you feel trapped in life. In other words, the pressures brought about by civilization.

There is a titillating feeling associated with randomness. We like the moderate (and highly domesticated) world of games, from spectator sports to having our breathing suspended between crap shoots during the next visit to Las Vegas. I myself, while writing these lines, try to avoid the tyranny of a precise and explicit plan, drawing from an opaque source inside me that gives me surprises.

Eliza wondered how many of her decisions were basically points of honour. Throughout her life, her job at the university, the bicycles and vegetarianism, even her haircut seemed as if they were chosen in reaction to the opinions of an invisible audience. She had become the sort of person she approved of but she wasn’t sure she had chosen anything she actually wanted. She checked the pillow one last time and turned off the bedside light. She would sort out the ants in the morning.

The reason this sensation feels profound, the reason it surprises you and remains with you with some intensity in later years, is that the very feeling you experienced in your moment of clarity was so completely opposite to your usual frame of mind. For most of your life, you are accustomed to a sense of your own importance; that the choices you make and the actions you perform have weight and consequence. You worry about a word misspoken or a decision rushed. You view other lives in relation to their significance and connection to you. Your parents, your children, your friends. You view your own life in relation to your successes and defeats.

If you wonder why this cause held my attention for so long even when my knowledge had expanded far beyond my immediate realm, imagine yourself born into a small community, a farming cooperative or an extended family household. You know your job. You work each day for the benefit of the unit and do not question your part in it, only your success or failure to complete the task. The members of the community know your business, share your living quarters, your food, your conversation. The question is not whether you would like or dislike such an existence, as liking and disliking are not part of your programming. Your life just is. But one day some flaw or fault, or perhaps some greater code, in the genetic lottery leads you astray. You receive an unknown signal, call it a gut instinct, to change the pattern and leave everything you have known behind. Your new job requires the skills you already have, but you work alone. You learn a new language, develop ingenious working methods, investigate a purpose for which you have sole responsibility for success or failure. The voices in your head are replaced with your own thoughts and feelings. What happens when the task is complete? You cannot go back to the life you had. You wouldn’t last a day.

‘Mummy said we shouldn’t have secrets, Greg,’ Arthur shouted as he struggled into the neck hole. ‘The dead one?’ Greg asked from the depths of the velvet cushions. ‘Yeah.’ Arthur smiled. ‘That one.’ Hal pulled down the jumper and gave his son’s shoulder a squeeze. ‘We’re going to be late.’ A minute later the door closed behind them. Silence filled the flat. Greg mopped up the rest of the maple syrup with his fingers and lay down again. Work could wait. He wanted to replay the conversation with Arthur a few times first.

‘We don’t know the end,’ Greg said as they got into the car. Hal glanced at him as he checked the rear view mirror and pulled away from the kerb. ‘Who doesn’t?’ ‘It’s what Arthur said. He said we don’t know the end.’ ‘He’s right.’ Hal nodded. ‘That’s why we can’t understand.’ ‘Is this to do with Rachel?’ Greg looked at Hal. His husband’s face was blurred through his fogged glasses and the shadows of street lights but Greg could see the statuesque head and waves of dark hair, the deep ridges of his brow and the short beard that softened the lines of his jaw. He put a hand on Hal’s leg. ‘I think so,’ he said. The hand on Hal’s thigh pressed down a little. Seven years. In that time they had married, had a child, lost a friend and a parent, bought a home, formed an allegiance against the world. A long time, so much lost and won, and a short time, a fraction of their lives.

More worrisome, U.S. policy toward the Middle East has historically, and especially since September 11, 2001, been unduly focused on the repression of any and all political fluctuations in the name of preventing “Islamic fundamentalism”—a trope that almost every regime has used. Aside from the fact that killing Islamists compounds their numbers, the West and its autocratic Arab allies have strengthened Islamic fundamentalists by forcing them underground.

Practically, the old have no very important advice to give the young, their own experience has been so partial, and their lives have been such miserable failures, for private reasons, as they must believe; and it may be that they have some faith left which belies that experience, and they are only less young than they were. I have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors. They have told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me anything to the purpose. Here is life, an experiment to a great extent untried by me; but it does not avail me that they have tried it.

It is the accumulated pressure of feelings that causes thoughts. One feeling, for instance, can create literally thousands of thoughts over a period of time. Think, for instance, of one painful memory from early life, one terrible regret that has been hidden. Look at all the years and years of thoughts associated with that single event. If we could surrender the underlying painful feeling, all of those thoughts would disappear instantly and we would forget the event.

Everything in the universe emits a vibration. The higher the vibration, the more power it has. Emotions, also, because they are energy, emit vibrations. These emotional vibrations impact the body’s energy fields and reveal effects that can be seen, felt, and measured. Motion pictures using Kirlian photography, such as those done by Dr. Thelma Moss, show rapid fluctuations of the color and size of the energy field with changes of emotions (Krippner, 1974). The energy field has traditionally been called an “aura” and can be seen by people who have been born with or learned the ability to see vibrations of that frequency. The aura changes color and size with emotions. Muscle-testing also demonstrates the energy changes that accompany emotions, as our body’s muscles instantly respond to positive and negative stimuli. Thus, our basic emotional states transmit themselves to the universe.

The mind is, therefore, a survival mechanism, and its method of survival is primarily the use of emotions. Thoughts are engendered by the emotions and, eventually, emotions become shorthand for thoughts. Thousands and even millions of thoughts can be replaced by a single emotion. Emotions are more basic and primitive than mental processes. Reason is the tool the mind uses to achieve its emotional ends. When used by the intellect, the basic underlying emotion is usually unconscious or at least out of awareness. When the underlying emotion is forgotten or ignored and not experienced, people are unaware of the reason for their actions and they develop all kinds of plausible reasons. In fact, they frequently do not know why they are doing what they are doing.

The price of holding on to smallness can be demonstrated with muscle testing. The procedure is fairly simple (Hawkins, [1995], 2012). Hold in mind a mean, petty thought and have someone press down on your arm while you resist; notice the effect. Now choose the exact opposite view. Picture yourself as being generous, forgiving, loving, and experiencing your inner greatness. Instantly, there will be an enormous increase in muscle strength indicating a surge of positive bio-energy. Smallness brings weakness, sickness, disease, and death. Do you really want that?

If we look at the source of our thoughts, begin to identify their origins, and stop the vanity of labeling them as “mine” (and therefore sacrosanct), we notice that thoughts can be looked at objectively. We see that their origins were often the early childhood training from parents, family, and teachers, as well as dribbles and drabbles of information we picked up from playmates, newspapers, movies, television, radio, church, novels, and the automatic input from our senses.

As we examine our “I can’ts” and find out that they are really “I won’ts,” it doesn’t mean that we have to let go of the negative feelings that result in the “I won’ts.” We are perfectly free to refuse to let go. We are free to hang on to negativity as long as we want. There is no law that says we have to give it up. We are free agents. But it makes a big difference in our self-concept to realize that “I won’t do something” is quite a different feeling than to think that “I’m a victim and I can’t.”

We can look at our major love relationships and honestly examine them. To what degree do they subserve our selfish inner needs? To what degree are we really using the other person to exploit them for our own gain? To what degree are they merely subserving our happiness? To find out, all we need to do is ask ourselves: “If their happiness were best served by leaving me, how would I feel about it?” This reveals the degree to which we are trying to restrict and control the other person—which is attachment and not love.

For over a year, there was a resentment and consequent avoidance of the person because of the emotional discomfort, which was compounded by the guilt at holding the resentment in the first place. Finally, when it became apparent that the only person suffering from the resentment was the person holding it, and that it was costing peace of mind, the willingness to let it go emerged. At that point, the resentment was fairly easy to let go and the borrower was forgiven. The $200 was re-contextualized as a loan to someone who had been in need. Within a few months, there was an unexpected encounter with the person, who said out of the blue, “I have been concerned about the money I owe you. Here’s the whole $200.” The loan was repaid without even asking for it.

It may of course be possible to arrive at truths without philosophizing. Without following a Socratic method, we may realize that people with no money may be called virtuous if they have lived through situations in which it was impossible to be virtuous and make money, or that acting courageously can involve retreat in battle. But we risk not knowing how to respond to people who don’t agree with us, unless we have first thought through the objections to our position logically. We may be silenced by impressive figures who tell us forcefully that money is essential to virtue and that only effeminates retreat in battle. Lacking counterarguments to lend us strength (the battle of Plataea and enrichment in a corrupt society), we will have to propose limply or petulantly that we feel we are right, without being able to explain why.

Social life is beset with disparities between others’ perceptions of us and our reality. We are accused of stupidity when we are being cautious. Our shyness is taken for arrogance and our desire to please for sycophancy. We struggle to clear up a misunderstanding, but our throat goes dry and the words found are not the ones meant. Bitter enemies are appointed to positions of power over us, and denounce us to others.

We don’t exist unless there is someone who can see us existing, what we say has no meaning until someone can understand, while to be surrounded by friends is constantly to have our identity confirmed; their knowledge and care for us have the power to pull us from our numbness. In small comments, many of them teasing, they reveal they know our foibles and accept them and so, in turn, accept that we have a place in the world. We can ask them ‘Isn’t he frightening?’ or ‘Do you ever feel that …?’ and be understood, rather than encounter the puzzled ‘No, not particularly’ – which can make us feel, even when in company, as lonely as polar explorers.

If one thought rationally about mortality, one would, Epicurus argued, realize that there was nothing but oblivion after death, and that ‘what is no trouble when it arrives is an idle worry in anticipation.’ It was senseless to alarm oneself in advance about a state which one would never experience: There is nothing dreadful in life for the man who has truly comprehended that there is nothing terrible in not living.

Why, then, if expensive things cannot bring us remarkable joy, are we so powerfully drawn to them? Because of an error similar to that of the migraine sufferer who drills a hole in the side of his skull: because expensive objects can feel like plausible solutions to needs we don’t understand. Objects mimic in a material dimension what we require in a psychological one. We need to rearrange our minds but are lured towards new shelves. We buy a cashmere cardigan as a substitute for the counsel of friends.

But anger does not belong in the category of involuntary physical movement, it can only break out on the back of certain rationally held ideas; if we can only change the ideas, we will change our propensity to anger. 3. And in the Senecan view what makes us angry are dangerously optimistic notions about what the world and other people are like.

If most philosophers feel no need to write like this, it is because they trust that, so long as an argument is logical, the style in which it is presented to the reader will not determine its effectiveness. Seneca believed in a different picture of the mind. Arguments are like eels: however logical, they may slip from the mind’s weak grasp unless fixed there by imagery and style. We need metaphors to derive a sense of what cannot be seen or touched, or else we will forget.

The friendship would not have been so valuable if most people had not been so disappointing – if Montaigne had not had to hide so much of himself from them.

Authorship was prompted by disappointment with those in the vicinity, and yet it was infused with the hope that someone elsewhere would understand; his book an address to everyone and no one in particular. He was aware of the paradox of expressing his deepest self to strangers in bookshops: Many things that I would not care to tell any individual man I tell to the public, and for knowledge of my most secret thoughts, I refer my most loyal friends to a bookseller’s stall. And yet we should be grateful for the paradox. Booksellers are the most valuable destination for the lonely, given the numbers of books that were written because authors couldn’t find anyone to talk to.

Montaigne distinguished between two categories of knowledge: learning and wisdom. In the category of learning he placed, among other subjects, logic, etymology, grammar, Latin and Greek. And in the category of wisdom, he placed a far broader, more elusive and more valuable kind of knowledge, everything that could help a person to live well, by which Montaigne meant, help them to live happily and morally.

They’re doing it to control their mental state. They’re doing it to control how they react. Some people drink because it helps them not care as much, or they’re potheads because they can zone out, or they do psychedelics to feel very present or connected to nature.

Honesty is a core, core, core value. By honesty, I mean I want to be able to just be me. I never want to be in an environment or around people where I have to watch what I say. If I disconnect what I’m thinking from what I’m saying, it creates multiple threads in my mind. I’m no longer in the moment—now I have to be future-planning or past-regretting every time I talk to somebody. Anyone around whom I can’t be fully honest, I don’t want to be around.

According to Lao-tse, the more man interfered with the natural balance produced and governed by the universal laws, the further away the harmony retreated into the distance. The more forcing, the more trouble. Whether heavy or light, wet or dry, fast or slow, everything had its own nature already within it, which could not be violated without causing difficulties. When abstract and arbitrary rules were imposed from the outside, struggle was inevitable. Only then did life become sour.

Now we come to what could be called the most characteristic element of Taoism-in-action. In Chinese, it is known as Wu Wei. It is also the most characteristic element of Pooh-in-action. In English, it is not known as much of anything in particular. We believe that it's time that someone noticed it and called it something, so we will call it the Pooh Way. Literally, Wu Wei means "without doing, causing, or making." But practically speaking, it means without meddlesome, combative, or egotistical effort. It seems rather significant that the character Wei developed from the symbols for a clawing hand and a monkey, since the term Wu Wei means no going against the nature of things; no clever tampering; no Monkeying Around.

When a movie begins with the words ‘Based on a True Story,’ what crosses your mind? Do you assume every line of dialogue, every bit of clothing and song in the background is the same as it was in the true event on which the film was based? Of course you don’t. You know movies like Pearl Harbor or Erin Brockovich take artistic license with facts, shaping them so a coherent story will unfold with a beginning, middle, and end. Even biopics about the lives of musicians or politicians who are still alive are rarely the absolute truth. Some things are left out, or some people are fused into single characters. The details, you think when watching, are less important than the big picture, the general idea. If only you were so savvy when it came to looking back on the biopic in your head.

When someone tells you about an argument they were involved in, do you not administer a dose of scepticism? You know you’re hearing only their version of the events. They’ve turned something complex into a neat story (usually one that leaves them suspiciously blameless). You know there will be a lot more to it that’s been left out: how frustrating or antagonistic they may have been themselves; how the other person may have been misunderstood. You know that events have been exaggerated and simplified so that the person can get their point across.

The initial administration of the drug via injection was followed by homework: they had to report to us all the positive changes they were noticing. Naturally, this task would encourage them to live out their new story each day. This is ‘confirmation bias’ at work: one of the most reliable cognitive snares to which we are prone. Confirmation bias occurs when we notice things in the world that support our beliefs and pay less attention to things that contradict them. People fall into this trap when they notice the times their prayers have been ‘answered’ but explain away or ignore the many more times they haven’t.

The psychological reason for this can be expressed simply – your happiness levels are largely defined by the balance of your personality. How happy you are by default is largely set. Now, there is more to the story of course, and the aim of this book is to explore some of the powerful, transformative possibilities that are open to us. But money does not affect this core aspect of your character: if you are prone to unhappiness when poor, you are very likely to be prone to unhappiness when rich. The vital changes to our happiness do not come from outside circumstances, however appealing they might seem.

Irvine’s thought exercise shows that our desires would diminish drastically if we didn’t need to impress anyone. Our requirements would probably become limited to what we might think of as ‘natural’ or essential desires: food, water, shelter and so on. This does not sound like a particularly pleasant existence or a lifestyle we would choose, but we would certainly be liberated from a desire to impress others.

Such unnecessary things, of course, constitute the vast majority of our desires. And once we realise that satisfaction is relative, we see that we may never achieve it as long as a notable disparity continues to exist between what we feel is worth attaining and what we actually possess. Unnecessary desires are ‘without end’ because that disparity will always push us forwards to desiring more and therefore towards further dissatisfaction, and they are ‘difficult to satisfy’ because they either come at a great cost or because of their never-ending and self-perpetuating nature.

How, without the aid of an analyst, might we get it right? How can we live a life that we will, even in our last days, be sure to deem our best effort? What of the things we enjoy, the things that make us happy now – what if they turn out to be our biggest regrets? It is an extraordinary thought that we could line up the things that bring us pleasure now and spend our life exploring these activities one after another and still come to the end deeply regretting the lifestyle we chose. And, perhaps, so what if we do? Why should the anticipation of future introspective thoughts triggered by illness in the final few months of our lives dictate the choices we make now and for decades ahead? Is it not potentially just as disastrous to live one’s life with the goal of dying happily and without regret, just to find that our regret is that we did not live for the moment while we could?

When we look back over our lives and decide if we have had a happy time in this world, it is the remembering self that is making that judgement. However, it may be that some of those choices we made, which satisfied the future remembering self, were not at the time the most enjoyable experiences and therefore did not provide particular pleasure to the experiencing self. For our purposes, Kahneman’s separation of those two selves seems to correlate with what we might intuitively understand to be the separation of happiness and pleasure: the former comes from a judgement we make, a sense of things being or having been right or as we would like them to be, and tends to be retrospective; whereas the latter relates to what we are being made to directly feel right now. Thus you might choose to spend an afternoon attending to a sick relative rather than go to a theme park with friends, choosing the least ‘pleasurable’ option and leaving your experiencing self less fulfilled. But this choice might furnish your future remembering self with a better story of how you spent your afternoon and even contribute to a wider sense of happiness regarding what you do with your life.

My encouragement, then, to lead a considered life (before we look at some suggestions as to what that might entail) is an appeal to acknowledge what Kahneman calls ‘the tyranny of the remembering self’. We don’t need to treat it as oppressive, but we can acknowledge that it has the upper hand. To live well and happily necessitates that we engage with this side of ourselves. If we don’t engage with our stories, taking our cue from passing pleasure, we pander only to our bestial experiencing self. This has an attention span of about three seconds, and its reports are quickly superseded by those of its story-loving, identity-forming superior. We might enjoy plenty of experiences along the way, but they will not tend to correlate with any particular feeling of happiness.

For example, we can recognise what it is we like about somebody (some aspect of their beauty, or their goodness, or intelligence, or wit) and admire it as a quality quite separate from that particular person, rather than confusing it with him or her. We can learn from it, perhaps try to develop it in ourselves and know how to recognise it in others. We may also appreciate that those positive qualities continue to reside in a person even when they are annoying us and seem to have lost all their redeeming aspects. An ability to see beyond the individual may be of great therapeutic value if we find ourselves infatuated with someone. We are far less likely to come to idolise a person if we can recognise that what we admire about them are qualities that exist separately from the particular (and therefore flawed) example that they constitute.

A certain amount of anger when, for example, a loved one is threatened, would be a sign of virtue: too much would be excessive, and to show none at all would suggest an effeminacy or spinelessness that was not a part of the noble life.

“That is a story from a dozen generations ago.” “More than a dozen,” I said. “Watch out, your fish.” The spit had drooped from his hand, and the fish was blackening on the coals. He did not rescue it. His eyes were fixed on me. “But you are my age.” My face had tricked him. It looked as young as his. I laughed. “No. I am not.” He had been half slouched to one side, knees touching mine. Now he jerked upright, pulling away from me so fast I felt the cold where he had been. It surprised me. “Those years are nothing,” I said. “I made no use of them. You know as much of the world as I do.” I reached for his hand.

Firstly, as McMahon explains in The Pursuit of Happiness, the attainment of perfect happiness ceased to be a concern of the here and now and became something that would happen in the far-off future. In Heaven, or after the parousia (the Second Coming), happiness beckoned to us from just over the distant horizon. No longer was it to be measured in a lifespan; now it was the stuff of eternity. Secondly, and closely connected with this first paradigm shift, we were told we should suffer now to obtain this happiness later. In fact, rather than avoid suffering as the Stoics and Epicureans taught, we were now instructed to embrace it as a sign of holiness. It’s hard to overestimate the impact that these new ideas have had on our culture ever since.

He shrugged. “Who can ever explain how divine bloodlines work? As for why no one said, I suspect they didn’t know. I spend more time with mortals than most gods and have grown accustomed to their sounds. To me it is only another flavor, like season in food. But if you are ever among men, you’ll notice it: they won’t fear you as they fear the rest of us.” In a minute he had unraveled one of the great mysteries of my life. I raised my fingers to my throat as if I could touch the strangeness that lay there. A god with a mortal’s voice. It was a shock, and yet there was part of me that felt something almost like recognition.

My anger spilled its banks. “I am not your dog, Pasiphaë, nor your bear to be baited. I came to your aid, despite all our history, despite the men you sent to their deaths. I helped you with your monster. I have done your work for you, and all you give me is mockery and contempt. For once in your twisting life, speak the truth. You brought me here to make me your fool.” “Oh, that requires no effort from me,” she said. “You are a fool on your own.” But it was reflexive, not a real answer. I waited. “It is funny,” she said, “that even after all this time, you still believe you should be rewarded, just because you have been obedient.

At last he said, “It was a bad life.” “There are many who are unhappier.” “No.” His vehemence startled me. “I do not mean a bad life for him. I mean that he made life for others a misery. Why did his men go to that cave in the first place? Because he wanted more treasure. And Poseidon’s wrath that everyone pitied him for? He brought it on himself. Because he could not bear to leave the cyclops without taking credit for the trick.”

The anger stood out plain and clean on his face. There was a sort of innocence to him, I thought. I do not mean this as the poets mean it: a virtue to be broken by the story’s end, or else upheld at greatest cost. Nor do I mean that he was foolish or guileless. I mean that he was made only of himself, without the dregs that clog the rest of us. He thought and felt and acted, and all these things made a straight line. No wonder his father had been so baffled by him. He would have been always looking for the hidden meaning, the knife in the dark. But Telemachus carried his blade in the open.

The light faded back to simple sun. Penelope and Telemachus eased away. Telegonus embraced me as he had not since he was a child. As maybe he never had. Remember this, I told myself. His wide shoulders, the curve of the bones in his back, the warmth of his breath. But my mind felt parched and windswept. “Mother? Can you not be happy for me?” No, I wanted to shout at him. No, I cannot. Why must I be happy? Is it not enough that I let you go? But I did not want for that to be the last he saw of me, his mother shrieking and keening as if he were dead, though he was still filled with so many hopeful years. “I am happy for you,” I made myself say.

I tried to imagine those dusky hills and gray meadows, the shades moving slow and white among them. Some walked hand in hand with those they had loved in life; some waited, secure that one day their beloved would come. And for those who had not loved, whose lives had been filled with pain and horror, there was the black river Lethe, where one might drink and forget. Some consolation.

My sister and brothers. My father. I felt something in me then. It was like the old, early days of my spells, when the path would open, sudden and clear before my feet. All those years I had wrestled and fought, yet there was a part of me that had stood still, just as my sister said. I seemed to hear that pale creature in his black depths. Then, child, make another.

Perhaps because our first question upon meeting people tends to be ‘What do you do?’, and because this is taken to mean ‘What do you do for a living?’, we are used to being judged on the basis of our jobs. When we ask this question, we rarely think to enquire what the person’s relationship to their job might be. Might they, for example, be indifferently employed, in order to create for themselves enough leisure time and a comfortable income to pursue their real interests? Perhaps you already dislike being asked what you do for a living because you feel the answer you have to give does you no justice. Why should the business of the firm you visit every day between certain hours be of any relevance when you are hoping to make an interesting personal connection with someone at a party?

Freud’s extraordinary legacy was to alter forever our treatment of psychological dis-ease and restore dignity to sufferers who at the time would have been simply incarcerated, castrated or left to die. Freud’s consulting room provided a confidential place for a person to talk, frankly and probably for the first time, about sex and anguish, to be understood and find healing. This in itself is a leap forward in the story of happiness, and perhaps for the first time in history a positive development that relates specifically to those who find themselves unhappy. While many of Freud’s approaches have been revised, we now live in a society where we can understand and appreciate that our troublesome urges and predilections might be the result of early trauma and come to understand ourselves and our complexities all the better.

The Romantic legacy, reinforced by any number of novels and films, encourages us to believe that we should seek out magical solutions to our feelings of isolation; that some magical ‘other’ is available to us in the form of a perfect partner, or perhaps a perfect job, to complete us and leave us perennially fulfilled.

There is more to Epicurus’s advice. He reminds us to desire what we already have, rather than to desire more and more unnecessary things: ‘Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.’ So he is not suggesting a purely negative process of resisting the lure of advertising and making sure we don’t become too attached to unnecessary things. We can also re-evaluate the things we do have. If we are going to feel a little too attached to the idea of an iPhone, let’s allow ourselves to nurture a sentimental attachment to our current one.

This encouraging of our self-sufficiency in our relationships also points to another aspect of Epicureanism that is both a weakness and a strength. They shut themselves away in their garden and were not concerned about the welfare of others. There is a natural reclusiveness and selfishness about the philosophy of the Epicureans. The Stoics, by contrast, were keen that we try to be the best citizens possible, and that notion has fed into the Christian model of civic duty with which we are still falteringly familiar. The Epicureans had none of that, and there’s no doubt that at times the lack of social obligation is rather compelling.

Following the initial shock, the feeling of hurt that had haunted us for days is transformed into something very loving.

This fights against a very different but well-received view of emotions, which is that they arise from some deep, animal, irrational place within us, quite separate from our intellectual faculties. This school of thought says that intellect is of the mind and emotions are of the body. We are born with our capacity for grief and anger and despair in place, whereas we learn reasoning through the society in which we live. This kind of thinking, while no longer exerting a strong influence in the field of psychology, nonetheless deeply affects the way we tend to talk of our emotions as very separate from reasoning. The Greeks, however, were not of this opinion, and their preferred model – that emotions stem from how we interpret events – now once again has the upper ground in modern clinical understanding. For

if, as the Greeks believed, our emotions are tied up with our thoughts and beliefs, if they are in essence ‘cognitive’ and will change and shift as those beliefs are modified, then we can see them as fundamentally rational. We can in fact delve deeper and decide if certain emotions are reasonable or unreasonable, true or false and so on, depending on their logical relation to the belief being held. If on the other hand we adopt the model that separates intellect and emotion, then when David insults Jane, we would say that a primal response called anger is directly triggered in Jane and that her anger comes from a very different place to her rational thinking. Let’s instead understand the anger as a response to Jane’s own judgement or interior narrative about what David said.

‘Venting’ does not solve emotional problems as the metaphor of pipes, valves and steam suggests. In the mid-twentieth century, the human-potential movement encouraged us to cry, scream and beat ‘boffers’ (cushioned pads) to release our pain. The therapy rooms and encounter groups of the 1970s reverberated with the thwump of fist meeting cushion. More recently, Brad Bushman and team at Iowa State University effectively demolished the myth that this kind of activity helps us to feel better. In fact, their research shows it actually tends to make us more aggressive. Beating a pillow might legitimise our feelings of anger, encouraging us to relive them later, and we may become too attached to a venting activity that we feel should bring us catharsis and find ourselves searching for an assuagement that never comes.

‘This is happening to my body, but it isn’t happening to me.’ We may find this too far-fetched, as did many of the Stoics’ contemporaries, but the reality is that for the person being tortured or abused, the kind of detachment that the Stoic message encourages might be the only comfort remaining. The message is not ‘blame yourself’ but to realise that whatever happens to you, it does not need to affect you, your core self, unless you choose to let it. Understood correctly, that is a powerful message of hope and a core survival skill for victims of oppression. Viktor E. Frankl’s extraordinary memoir from the concentration camps, Man’s Search for Meaning, is a moving testimony to this fact: ‘Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.’

The consensus from these writers was that anger is an entirely negative, unmerited emotion. You may disagree. One dissenting thought that preceded theirs came from Aristotle: he believed that there is a use for anger, as long as it is correctly placed: Anybody can become angry – that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way – that is not within everybody’s power and is not easy.3 His system of virtue, you may remember, was based on achieving a mean between deficiency and excess in certain qualities. Too much anger and one becomes irascible; too little and one is guilty of aorgēsia, a spineless lack of spirit.

But occasionally I wonder about the brightly coloured, high-contrast world in which he must live. It must be different from mine. His judgements of events would seem to be starker than those I would form. Because we forget about the role of our appraisals and tend to ascribe our feelings to the events themselves and those who perpetrate them, two people with different judgements will live, by all accounts, in two different worlds.

This struck me as a very useful experience. When faced with the distress of others, we tend to assume a calming role. Commonly, this happens when we talk to a friend who is facing difficulty. We see their concern, acknowledge their view of events, but calmly present a different, less worrisome view. Were we to be facing a similar difficulty, a friend would be likely to do the same. She would hopefully provide reasons not to fret and highlight certain pieces of positive evidence that would help us view things differently. Whether it is anxiety or anger that is the cause of the distress, these discussions serve to undo the chain of trigger > judgement > inhibitions > behaviour by focusing on the ‘judgement’ component and trying to shift it. ‘It’s good that bastard has left you: he was no good for you.’ ‘You’ll be fine giving that presentation: you’re well prepared and a few nerves are a good thing.’

You can have all the talent in the world, but if you don’t show it to a public and get it ‘out there’, it’ll do you little good. Likewise, you can have all the self-promotional energy anyone could hope for, but if you have no real talent to back it up it won’t get you very far. The development of your talent and the energy with which you approach that aspect of your life are of course two things that are under your control. Success itself is not.

Consider your early memories. Snapshots within the house you lived in when you were young: the first pet, the picture on the wall in your bedroom, a pattern on the wallpaper or couch, cakes and cake tins. The times you got severely told off. Times of trauma. Brief moments from early birthday parties, dim images that flicker like candles, which you have confused with blurry photographs you’ve seen since. Old toys and TV shows, holidays, early lessons at school. Then, as you remember how you grew up, you can trace the lines of experience that have more obviously formed the adult you are now. You notice aspects of your relationship with your parents that affect so much of your behaviour today. Moments you have shared with people along the way – early sexual experiences and infatuations, tough and great memories from school. From this tangle of events you have formed certain beliefs about the world. What is important and what is not. You’ve perhaps discovered some way of connecting with something bigger than yourself – through religion, through sport, music or art, or through some other endeavour that brings you out of your own head for a while and makes you feel that life can be rich and worthwhile. All this continues to feed into that filter that makes your world unique; that causes you to notice certain things and ignore others as you look across a room of people; that informs your beliefs, or set of priorities, or measuring stick by which you assess others, their behaviour and transgressions, and which allows you to arrive at the most obvious sense (to you) of what’s normal. If you have children, you are consciously or unconsciously passing some of these values on to them; this is the legacy of learning and amassing thoughts and working things out and gradually becoming you, that particular individual who looks out on the world and views it as you do right now. Maybe you have a career that has allowed you to build some reputation or security. Perhaps you are, as an adult now, revered in some way by your community. Perhaps you are creatively gifted, perhaps you have fought to get where you are. Maybe you are young but are looking forward to a career trajectory and enjoy planning for success. All of this and more constitutes your world. Let us then consider the harsh reality for a moment: it will all amount to nothing. Everything you have strived for, or intend to strive for, will cease to be. Your friends, family, your children will as good as disappear along with your world. The story of you, the framework of your world, will amount to nothing and most likely remain untold, without significance. That very self – that sense of I from which you are considering this right now – will be gone too. ‘But life will continue without me,’ you insist. My perspective will flicker and die but those of other people will persist. Seven billion or so other outlooks will continue, each supplying its owner with a particular slant on the world as uniquely inaccurate as yours was when it existed. In the worldviews of those who knew you, in which you were never the central character, a faint, semi-fictionalised version of you will exist as a set of memories and feelings that they attach to a mental picture of your face. If you happen to be one of the renowned few who establishes a legacy through a book or hospital wing that bears your name, then a sort of synthetic memory will kick around for a bit longer, before the work is no longer read or your hospital wing is renamed or knocked down. Meanwhile, those who remember your name or face will themselves come to breathe their last, and the final wisps of your posthumous presence will disappear as all recollection of you is snuffed out without trace or murmur. ‘He is a collection of tissues and cells delicately and intricately conjoined and brought to life for only an instant. It will take just one sharp collision or a fall to render them inanimate again,’ realises Rabih, the quiet hero of Alain de Botton’s The Course of Love. ‘He is only a visitor who has managed to confuse his self with the world. He had assumed he was yet another stable object, like the city of Edinburgh or a tree or a book, whereas he is more like a shadow or a sound.’ Only you carry your story in the world, and it must vanish with you. As the novelist Milan Kundera phrased it: ‘What terrifies most about death is not the loss of the future but the loss of the past. In fact, the act of forgetting is a form of death always present within life.’1 Such is the finality of death. So how could that possibly help us or allow us to find happiness?

The subliminal ethos being subtly weaved is that good things happen to good people, and bad things happen to bad people. This is utter balderdash. The reality is that good and bad things happen to all people, death perhaps being the most extreme (and yet the most common) example.

The thought of still having to go through the ten hours of agony is horrible. In other words, we feel very differently about pain that has happened in the past and pain that is yet to come. Pain we prefer to be behind us, and positive experiences in our future. We have a certain ‘future bias’ that means we care more about what’s yet to happen. An abyss of nothingness ahead of us, then, is not the same to us as one that’s been and gone in the past. And this bias is a good argument against Lucretius. His symmetry fails if past and future should not be treated the same. Our bias that wants anything bad to be in the past leads us to a good reason as to why it is rational after all to feel that death is a bad thing. And this reason holds an important key, I think, to how we might enhance our time while we’re alive and well.

The same conclusion is reached when we consider our immortality. When we know that we will come to experience every permutation of happenstance (or near enough if we consider even a lifespan of a mere trillion years), and when everything that can happen eventually will, then that life starts to look strangely empty and pointless.

Look at what takes up your time and see what is worth doing and what is not. Think about what provides enjoyment, connectivity, a sense of fulfilment, and what, when you look back, will have been a waste of time or stifled you. Look for ways of removing those latter activities from your life. Not only does this offer the benefit of removing negative behaviours, it also engages you with the considered life. Suddenly you have a vantage point from which to view your behaviour, and from there you can give your life shape and meaning.

When other people annoy us, or are in some way rude, we often see it as part of a pattern of behaviour. Even for close friends, we can identify behaviour that is ‘typical’ of how badly they deal with stress, or behave after a drink, or reliably let themselves down in some other scenario. For others of whom we are not so fond, we might see negative patterns very readily across the board. For ourselves, though, we do the opposite. If we bother to reflect on our behaviour when we have been rude, short-tempered or somehow let ourselves down, we see only exceptions and excuses.

Of course this is all thought-play and conjecture. But if we are convinced by this idea that without a future for humanity we would lose interest in a wide range of our activities and confidence in what we value (much like in the immortality case), then we arrive at a startling conclusion. It is not merely enough that we have in place the temporal finitude provided by our own death to ensure our lives have meaning. It is not enough that we die. We also need others to live on after us and without us. We need to die and others need to live. Which means ultimately that the continuing lives of others matter more to us than do our own.

If we accept this and think of ourselves – our consciousness – as patterns of thinking, then our ‘self’ is something that to one degree or other can be experienced by other people too. Let’s say I know you very well: I know your ‘story’, I’m well versed in your tastes, preferences and your ways of thinking. Then, if for a while I think and feel like you (perhaps while looking at a photograph of you or contemplating how you would behave in a certain situation), I am approximating in my body your brain pattern, at least a rough version of your ‘self’. It won’t ever be quite you, but I can be you with, Hofstadter would say, a ‘Derren’ accent. It’s like a translation of a book: my copy of Kafka’s story Metamorphosis, translated from the German, is undoubtedly the same story as the original Die Verwandlung, but it’s lost something. It’s got an accent, it’s an approximation, but as it’s still essentially the same pattern of thoughts and ideas and symbols, we can say it’s the same thing.

In old age, mindfulness can increase health by saving us from a diminishing sense of authorship of our stories. In a 1976 experiment by Langer and her colleagues, a number of elderly residents in a nursing home were given houseplants to look after and water. They were also encouraged to make decisions for themselves, such as where to receive visitors, and when movie night would occur on their floor. Meanwhile, a second control group was also given plants, but this time it was the nurses who looked after them and made decisions about visitors and movie showings. Three weeks later, the first group, who had been given responsibility, was happier and healthier. Eighteen months later, they were still significantly more active and sociable. But most astonishingly, this group lived longer. The mortality rate was twice as high in the group that had all their decisions made for them. Being granted authorship of our stories, and experiencing mindfulness rather than mindlessness, makes for happier and healthier lives.

It isn’t clear, though, that you would be eternally happy in heaven. The problem is that when you went there, you would take your personality with you—including, quite likely, a propensity to take whatever you have for granted. Before long, you would start taking heaven’s perfection for granted, and it would therefore cease to delight you.

When you are angry that someone has set you back, it is helpful to recall that although other people are responsible for many of the setbacks you experience, you are likewise responsible for many of theirs. Yes, you find them annoying, but maybe, just maybe, they find you annoying as well. In particular, they may be annoyed by how easily annoyed you are. This fact is easy to forget, given that you are more acutely aware of the problems others cause you than you are of the problems you cause them.

One sign of maturity is a realization of the extent to which you, either intentionally or unintentionally, make life difficult for those around you. Consequently, you should keep in mind the words of Seneca: “we are bad men living among bad men; and only one thing can calm us—we must agree to go easy on one another.”1

Because of the connection between setbacks and desires, if a person were incapable of experiencing desire, nothing would count as a setback. Conversely, to a person who has to have everything just so, setbacks will be routine occurrences in what is probably a very unhappy existence. Furthermore, a person with unusual desires will be subject to unusual setbacks. Most drowning people would be grateful if a good Samaritan pulled them from the water, but for someone trying to commit suicide, it would count as a setback. How many setbacks you experience depends, as I have suggested, on how much foresight you possess. The days of a thoughtless person are likely to be filled with obstacles that he failed to anticipate, and as a result, he is likely to find life both frustrating and unfair. Were he not so thoughtless, he would fathom the reason for his misfortune. Thoughtful people, by contrast, minimize the number of setbacks they experience by learning how the world works and using this knowledge to plan their activities. No matter how carefully they plan for the future, though, life will occasionally deal them a setback: the computer of their fully fueled and recently serviced hybrid vehicle might develop a glitch, thereby bringing it to a halt during rush hour on the freeway.

You can gain important insight into setbacks by monitoring the impact they have on your life. Try keeping a setback journal in which you record the setbacks you experience, their source, their significance, and your response to them. Doing this will make you aware of the extent to which setbacks carry a double cost.

When we aren’t watching sports, we might spend our time reading a novel. Our interest in literature can also be explained, in part, by our fascination with setbacks. Novels are full of them, and with good reason. A novel in which two characters fall in love on their first meeting, get married, never fight, and live happily ever after would be a commercial failure. Authors realize this and therefore go out of their way to confront characters with obstacles. As a result, their characters’ relationships don’t run smoothly: hearts get broken. Their lives are also filled with drama: they might contract an illness or be the victim of a crime. The same rule applies to cinema.

A resilient person will refuse to play the role of victim. To play this role is to invite pity, and she doesn’t regard herself as a pitiful being. She is strong and capable. She may not be able to control whether she is a target of injustice, but she has considerable control over how she responds to being targeted. She can let it ruin her day and possibly her life, or she can respond to it bravely, remaining upbeat while she looks for workarounds to the obstacles that people have wrongly placed in her path.

By treating a setback as a Stoic test, we take our subconscious mind out of the setback-response loop. More precisely, we preclude it from suggesting a finger-pointing explanation for a setback, an explanation that assumes that someone else is taking advantage of us or abusing us. This prevents the activation of our emotions, which not only dramatically lowers the personal cost of being set back but also improves our chances of dealing with the setback in a thoughtful manner. If this were all the Stoic test strategy accomplished, it would be worth our while to employ it in response to a setback. If we are clever in our use of the strategy, though, we can find ourselves not only avoiding negative emotions but also experiencing positive ones, including pride, satisfaction, and maybe even joy, as we rise to meet the challenge the setback represents. The Stoics, in other words, came up with a strategy for turning the setback lemons that life hands us into lemonade—or maybe even a lemon meringue pie.

WHEN LIFE PRESENTS US WITH A SETBACK, we have many ways to explain it—many different frames, that is, in which to place it. As we have seen, our subconscious mind tends to assume that it was other people who set us back and that they did so on purpose and even with malice. I will refer to this as the blame frame. Once our subconscious mind has done this, our emotions will be aroused, and we will likely get angry. What could have been merely a setback transmogrifies into an ordeal. Fortunately, our conscious mind has the ability to undermine the operation of our subconscious mind. In particular, by coming up with alternative explanations for our setbacks, it puts them in frames that are neutral or even beautiful. It thereby prevents negative emotions from being triggered, and it can even give rise to positive emotions. Let us, therefore, explore some of the alternative frames that are available to the conscious mind.

Under such circumstances, it would be absurd for you to point an accusing finger and place the event in a blame frame. You should instead place it in what might be called a game frame. Getting tackled is, after all, part of the game of rugby, and if you didn’t want to get tackled, you should have stayed off the field of play.

Have you ever wondered why orgasms are possible? It is because animals capable of experiencing them were more likely to mate and thereby have offspring than animals that weren’t. Likewise, have you ever wondered why we feel unpleasantly hungry if we go without eating for a long period and why we feel good when we do eat? It is because animals capable of having these feelings were more likely to stay nourished and therefore to survive than those that lacked them. An animal that thought fasting felt great and sex felt awful would have been unlikely to have any descendants. According to evolutionary biologists, this is how we came to possess the wiring that allows us to feel physically good and bad.2 With the passage of many generations, animals’ ability to feel good and bad gained another dimension: besides being able to experience physical feelings, they started experiencing mental feelings—also known as emotions. At first, these emotions were probably negative. Animals might, in particular, have come to fear things that experience told them would feel physically bad: after being bitten by a snake, they might develop a fear of snakes. With the passage of many more generations, these emotions became more complex. If, for example, animals returned to the place where they had been bitten by a snake, they might experience anxiety, another negative emotion, even though no snake was visible. And besides experiencing negative emotions, they would have started experiencing positive emotions. Suppose, for example, that one of our human ancestors threw a spear at a game animal. If it missed its target, the hunter might have experienced disappointment, a negative emotion, but if the spear found its target, he might have experienced a pleasant feeling of accomplishment. When their brains developed even further, our ancestors were rewarded for forming and subsequently achieving long-term goals. Each significant step they completed on their way to a goal was rewarded with a feeling of accomplishment, and on achieving their ultimate goal, they were rewarded with one of life’s greatest pleasures, the rush of success. These good feelings were made possible by a release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in their brain. Suppose that because you are lazy or lack self-confidence, you refuse to undertake difficult challenges. You thereby deprive yourself of the chance to experience the rush of success—unless, that is, you have access to cocaine. A hit of this drug will cause your brain to release copious amounts of dopamine, and as a result, you will experience a high very similar to the one you would experience on, say, sinking the game-winning shot in the championship basketball game. It is, to be sure, a risky and potentially addictive way to obtain this feeling. Because our ancestors were social animals, their well-being depended on their position within the social hierarchy. This in turn gave rise to social emotions. If someone snubbed them, they might feel humiliated, and if the incident jeopardized their social standing, they might get mad. They also started experiencing envy toward those above them in the hierarchy. These and other social emotions prompted them to behave in a manner likely to improve their social standing and thereby increase their chances of surviving and reproducing. We inherited our brain and its emotion-generating wiring from these ancestors. The thing to realize is that although we have added processing power to that brain, its basic wiring hasn’t changed much, and as a result, we experience many of the same emotions as they did. Our environment is, however, radically different from theirs. One of their big challenges was getting enough food to eat; one of ours is to avoid getting heart disease as a result of overindulging in cheap and readily available food. They had to worry about getting attacked by animals; we might worry about paying our bills or losing our job. Our brain, then, might be described as a computer with lots of processing power but an archaic operating system. It is our lot in life to be stuck with such a computer. The ancient Stoics hit on a way to hack that computer. They recognized the human tendency to blame setbacks on someone else and then to get angry at that person. They also realized that if we acted quickly, we could short-circuit this process. In particular, by framing the setback as a test of our resilience and ingenuity, we could not only prevent the onset of negative emotions but transform the setback into a challenge that we might enjoy undertaking. What for most people would simply have been an unpleasant incident might, for us, turn out to be kind of fun.

This book is not anti-intercourse, but rather pro-“outercourse”—a conception of sex that goes beyond penetration, embraces mutual pleasure, and is better suited to stimulating the female sexual anatomy to orgasm. This model doesn’t exclude intercourse, but instead promotes the postponement of male gratification until after a woman has achieved her first (but hopefully not last) orgasm during a session of sexual activity—a deferment that has the double benefit of vouchsafing female satisfaction while also significantly enhancing the quality of the male climax. This book espouses the postponement of gratification, not the postponement of enjoyment.

Studies, like those by Kinsey and Masters and Johnson, have concluded that among women whose partners spent twenty-one minutes or longer on foreplay, only 7.7 percent failed to reach orgasm consistently. That’s a shift of tectonic proportions—from two out of three women not being able to reach climax to nine out of ten achieving satisfaction—all because of a matter of minutes.

What these two examples demonstrate is that even if one adamantly subscribes to the idea of vaginal and G-spot orgasms as being discrete orgasmic experiences unto themselves, the clitoris is clearly the “starter” or catalyst for sexual response. While it’s possible to experience a clitoral orgasm without the presence of a vagina, it’s virtually impossible to experience a vaginal or G-spot orgasm without the presence of a clitoris. So when considering all of the various terms and types of female orgasm that are often bandied about, we can simplify matters by adopting “Occam’s razor,” the principle coined by the medieval philosopher William of Occam that lies at the root of all scientific modeling and theory building: Entia non sunt multiplicanda necessitatem. Translation: “One should not make more assumptions than are absolutely necessary.”

One of the biggest mistakes a lover can make is to underestimate the sensitivity of the clitoral head. In fact, at the peak of sexual arousal, the head becomes so sensitive that, with a little help from the suspensory ligament (an unseen part of the of the clitoris), it retracts beneath its hood and is often hidden at the moment of climax.

Perineum. The perineum is the small expanse of skin just above the anus and just beneath the vaginal entrance (sometimes referred to casually as the “taint,” because “it t’aint one or the other”). Beneath the skin of the perineum is a network of blood vessels and tissue, which fill with blood during arousal and become intensely sensitive. Dr. Kinsey observed during his research that the perineum is “highly sensitive to touch, and tactile stimulation of the area may provide considerable erotic arousal.” When making your travel plans of the clitoral network, make sure to include this southern hot spot.

“zone of erogenous feeling…located along the suburethral surface of the anterior vaginal wall.” In layman’s terms, Dr. Kinsey observed, “Most of those women who did notice some response had the sensitivity confined to a certain point, in most cases the upper wall of the vagina just inside the vaginal entrance.” For all its hype, the G-spot, as cited earlier, may simply be nothing more than the roots of the clitoris crisscrossing the urethral sponge. While sensitive to stimulation, but without nearly as many nerve endings as the clitoral head, the G-spot generally responds to a more persistent, massaging pressure. It’s not uncommon for a woman to feel a fleeting urge to urinate when this area is stimulated.

this book will make a somewhat radical break from the tradition of erotological literature by referring to the area that is generally known as the G-spot as the “clitoral cluster,” a name that more accurately, and simply, expresses its anatomical power and role in the process of female sexual response.

All in all, it does not appear that ejaculation, voluntary or involuntary, does much to enhance the pleasure of orgasm. To that end, a woman’s time would be better spent on Kegel exercises and the strengthening of the pelvic floor muscles—an exercise known to increase the quality of orgasmic contractions.

These contractions produce waves of pleasure, and with some women the orgasm is accompanied by the ejaculation of a small amount of clear, alkaline fluid.

While there’s no rule of thumb for the number of orgasmic contractions, women tend to experience six to ten contractions, whereas men generally have four to six. Once again, we are reminded of Masters and Johnson’s declaration that a woman has “an infinitely greater capacity for sexual response than a man ever dreamed of.”

The difference between how men and women experience the resolution phase is what I call the “snuggle gap”: women want more interaction; men want to roll over and go to sleep. While much literature has been devoted to the “insensitivity” of men and the “neediness” of women in this respect, it’s far more effective to understand that the snuggle gap is largely the result of biology (men crash quickly after sex, women come down slowly), so don’t overanalyze, or get angry and pick a fight; instead,

Fortunately, it’s possible to pinpoint the attitudes and practices that increase the likelihood of being at risk for an STD versus those that don’t. “Although we find that large numbers of Americans have had a sexually transmitted disease at least once in their lives, there is nothing random about where the diseases strike…the people who are most likely to be infected share one key characteristic: They have many sex partners.”

If a man has two to four sexual partners in his lifetime, his chances of contracting an STD are about 3 percent. As the number of partners increases, so does the risk. With more than twenty partners, his risk is about 28 percent. The same rough pattern is true of women, with the spectrum of percentages increasing from 5 to 35 percent.

Avoid: During foreplay avoid direct contact with her genitals for a minimum of ten to fifteen minutes. Stimulate other parts of her body; let the oxytocin wash over her and pervade her bloodstream. Save the genital kiss for last, as the first kiss upon the vulva is the threshold between foreplay and coreplay.

Breathing, hers: Most men think of vaginal wetness as the most reliable indicator of a woman’s level of arousal; and while there is indeed a strong correlation between lubrication and sexual response, she may or may not be wet for reasons that have nothing to do with her level of sexual excitement. Breathing, on the other hand, is an oft-neglected indicator. As she gets more aroused, look for the commensurate changes in her breathing, and tightening of the abdominal muscles.

Music: Use it to enhance the mood, not kill it. Find music that lulls you both into a deeper zone of letting go, music that helps you synchronize yourselves into a mutual sense of rhythm and pacing. The right choice can really stimulate the senses; the wrong choice can shut them down. One interviewee commented that she likes to play Ravel’s Boléro during sex as “it both captures and stimulates the process of arousal—the way the tension builds slowly, repetitiously…subliminally encouraging my boyfriend to slow down and wait until it all builds to a crescendo.”

If she climaxes during foreplay, transition for a few minutes into a milder form of stimulation such as kissing and hugging before moving into coreplay. This shift in activity is particularly essential if her orgasm was the result of manual stimulation of the clitoris, as the clitoral head is particularly sensitive to touch following orgasm. Let her cool down, but keep her warm and sexualized by focusing your attention on other parts of her body.

Penetration: If cunnilingus is coreplay, then it’s possible to think of genital penetration as an aspect of part of foreplay. In the standard missionary position—you on top, her beneath you—use the tip of your penis to barely penetrate her vaginal entrance. Let your penis rest just inside her. (If you’re uncomfortable in the missionary position, then simply kneel or sit in front of her vulva.) Linger. Loiter. Meander. Stay close to the entrance. Press your thumb against her clitoral head and gently flick it from side to side as you penetrate her with short shallow thrusts. Or press the shaft of your penis against her clitoris and then gently thrust between the folds of her labia without ever entering her. Or she can perform Kegels (the squeezing of her pelvic muscles) while you, ever so slowly, penetrate her. Really take the time to feel her pelvic muscles contract against your penis as you slowly withdraw.

She should start flat on her back, legs spread comfortably apart, but not too far (six to nine inches at most) and a bit bent at the knee. As a rule, her legs should always be closer together than farther apart, as she needs the full command of her pelvic muscles. She should be completely at ease and relaxed: able to focus on the pleasure she’s receiving without any distraction—physical or mental. • Pay attention to the arch of her back. Once again, we get the idea from porn that when a woman is turned on she naturally arches her back upward, throws back her head, and points her breasts and neck up and out. This position, while titillating, is what the famous sexologist Wilhelm Reich referred to as the “hysterical arch.” Not only is it highly unnatural, but the position also cuts off blood flow to the pelvic area, hampers breathing, and inhibits the process of sexual response. When a woman is aroused and comfortable, her back will find itself flat, without an arch, and her genitals will be tilted slightly up toward your mouth, rather than driving downward—in short, the opposite of what we see in porn. To help her achieve this naturally comfortable position, prop a pillow or two behind her neck and shoulders. • A pillow propped under her butt will help with blood flow to the pelvic region, as well as provide you with better access to her genitalia, making it easier for you to connect “lips” and alleviate stress to your neck.

Labia minora (external), also known as the little lips or the inner lips, they swell to nearly double their size when engorged with blood during arousal and respond best to tongue strokes, gentle nibbles, and playful fingertip pinches. 7. Vaginal entrance (external) contains the remnants of the hymen and, when amply aroused and lubricated, responds best to slow, long licks and gentle fingertip tickles. 8. Fourchette (external) is the area located at the base of the vaginal entrance where the bottoms of the labia minora converge, and responds best to tongue strokes and gentle fingertip tickles that just graze the vaginal entrance. 9.

This area responds well to fingertip pressure, fingertip insertion, and tongue strokes, but also contains bacteria that should be prevented from commingling with other parts of the vulva.

CAUTION: Never, under any circumstances, blow into a woman’s vagina as though trying to fill it with air. Doing so is seriously dangerous. Blowing into a woman’s vagina may cause an embolism and lead to death. Breathe on her; blow lightly on her; never blow into her.

Like a guest arriving at a much-anticipated dinner party, let your hostess know how excited you are to be there, how beautiful she looks, and how much you’re looking forward to the meal ahead. Put her at ease. Tease her, taunt her, tantalize her—make her think that she’s not ever going to get it, ever, and then, just when she’s on the brink of utter madness, give it to her.

Start at the base of her vaginal entrance, the fourchette, and work your way up. • Take in the full length of her labia minora (inner lips) and let your tongue rest briefly against her frenulum, the area just under the clitoral head. • As you go over the head, brush it lightly as a feather, and then proceed to her front commissure (the area just above the head). • Push down on her commissure with the tip of your tongue and feel the sinewy clitoral shaft beneath it. • As you kiss her slowly from top to bottom, press your finger lightly against her perineum (the expanse of skin just below her vaginal entrance). • When you lick the full span of her vaginal entrance from top to bottom, place your hand atop her mons pubis and nudge it gently toward her abdomen. This will stretch the skin and tighten her vaginal entrance, enabling you to lushly encompass her sensitive inner labia as you lick. • As an alternative to the standard position, grab hold of her upper thighs prior to the first kiss and pivot her legs up into the air so that only her butt is touching the bed and her vulva is completely exposed. No matter what your approach, take it long and slow, from bottom to top, and savor every step of the journey. Now that you’ve lavished her with the first kiss (that long full lick), let your tongue rest flat against the length of her vaginal entrance. Encompass her vulva with your tongue. Take a moment to let the experience of the first kiss resonate.

But channel that excitement into a slow, tender kiss that lavishes the entire area of the vulva rather than just the clitoral head. Remember, when it comes to cunnilingus first impressions count.

Make sure that the interval between licks is long enough to let each one resonate fully and completely. Like calling out her name in a tunnel or cave, wait until the echo has completely subsided before calling out once again. Later, as the momentum builds to a peak, action and reaction will overlap until they become virtually indistinguishable; but for now that’s a ways off. • Feel your tongue against her vulva. Let your respective nerve endings find one another and conjoin in embrace. See and feel your tongue fusing with her vulva, and then… • Break the contact. Your tongue should completely disconnect from her vulva for a split second, causing the slightest of tremors in her pelvis: an almost imperceptible shudder of shock from the loss of your tongue. Then…

It’s this “breaking and making” of contact between tongue and vulva that allows the buildup of sexual tension and will ultimately demand release through orgasm.

Get a rhythm going: long, slow lick/flat, still tongue; long, slow lick/flat still tongue. Each complete set should last about ten seconds, with five seconds on the lick and five on the flat embrace of tongue against vulva. • Repeat this pattern for about three minutes, or fifteen to twenty complete sets. Tongue Tip: As you get more familiar with the routine, use your hand to push up against her mons pubis for the lick (this tightens her vaginal entrance and brings her labia closer together), and then release when you lay your tongue flat against her vulva.

Now avoid the head. • Next, vary the routine with small halfway licks, from bottom to midvagina, avoiding the area of the clitoral head altogether. • Focus on stimulating her inner labia. This way you’re not overexciting the head (remember how sensitive it is). You’re teasing it, gently coaxing the head out from under its protective clitoral hood by switching your tongue strokes: from light, repetitive licks that gently graze her to deeper, halfway licks that now avoid her altogether.

The rhythm of iambic pentameter is simple and straightforward: da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum. Think about that rhythm as it applies to a line from Shakespeare: “Shall I/com-pare/thee to/a sum/mer’s day?” Now you’re ready to let your tongue take center stage. Grab your dusty college Shakespeare off the shelf, commit a few lines to memory, and then use your tongue to iambically stimulate her clitoris. Your performance will surely garner a standing ovation. You’ve alerted the clitoral head to a variation in rhythm; you’ve rescinded the attention that it grew accustomed to. In this way, you compel the head to find you, to seek out your tongue.

Tongue Tip: As an enhancement to these routines, perform them with her legs in the air. Get a firm grip on her thighs and raise both legs so that only her butt is touching the bed. Lick her vulva tenderly and gingerly and note the tension in her legs and pelvic area as she pushes against your hands. This “pushing against a point of resistance” is a key element in developing hypertonicity—the muscular tension that contributes to sexual response and orgasmic release.

Let’s Review 1. In this chapter, we discussed the importance of establishing rhythm and building a solid foundation, as well as exercising restraint when you might be tempted to apply rough passion. 2. After the first kiss, lick her vaginal entrance from top to bottom, and then rest your tongue flat against the surface of her vulva. Do this fifteen to twenty times. 3. Next, lick her five times with halfway strokes, focusing on the labia and staying clear of the head. On the sixth stroke, finish the movement and press the soft tip of your tongue into her head. 4. Repeat this pattern, increasing each set of halfway licks by one until you get to ten. 5. Use this routine to establish rhythm and acclimate the head to the attentions of your tongue.

• Flirt with her inner lips; trace the edges with your fingertip. Squeeze and pinch them playfully. Acquaint your index finger with all the diverse parts of her vulva, and take note of her responses. • Gently stimulate her front commissure, the smooth area just above the clitoral head and hood. • Lightly tap her frenulum, the region just below her clitoral head and above her vaginal entrance where her labia minora (inner lips) meet. • Tease her fourchette, the area where the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the vaginal entrance. • Gently tickle the lower base of her vaginal entrance. • As you allow your finger to wander, apply simple, steady tongue strokes. Note how the two work in combination. • Now that you’ve teased her vulva, slowly insert the first two inches or so of your index finger into her vagina. Your finger should go in quite easily (assuming she’s amply aroused and lubricated) and you will likely feel her interior pelvic muscles throb in response and the clitoral cuff tighten around you. • Hold the position straight and still as you continue to apply simple tongue strokes. Don’t rush to insert more fingers. Save them for later. For now, there’s a teasing aspect to the still, single finger and its presence stimulates her pelvic muscles to work: you’re giving her something to reach for that ultimately eludes her grasp.

When you are asked what you are thinking about, you can normally answer. You believe you know what goes on in your mind, which often consists of one conscious thought leading in an orderly way to another. But that is not the only way the mind works, nor indeed is that the typical way. Most impressions and thoughts arise in your conscious experience without your knowing how they got there. You cannot trace how you came to the belief that there is a lamp on the desk in front of you, or how you detected a hint of irritation in your spouse’s voice on the telephone, or how you managed to avoid a threat on the road before you became consciously aware of it. The mental work that produces impressions, intuitions, and many decisions goes on in silence in our mind.

Each question was a small experiment, and we carried out many experiments in a single day. We were not seriously looking for the correct answer to the statistical questions we posed. Our aim was to identify and analyze the intuitive answer, the first one that came to mind, the one we were tempted to make even when we knew it to be wrong. We believed—correctly, as it happened—that any intuition that the two of us shared would be shared by many other people as well, and that it would be easy to demonstrate its effects on judgments.

On another occasion, Amos and I wondered about the rate of divorce among professors in our university. We noticed that the question triggered a search of memory for divorced professors we knew or knew about, and that we judged the size of categories by the ease with which instances came to mind. We called this reliance on the ease of memory search the availability heuristic

An important advance is that emotion now looms much larger in our understanding of intuitive judgments and choices than it did in the past. The executive’s decision would today be described as an example of the affect heuristic, where judgments and decisions are guided directly by feelings of liking and disliking, with little deliberation or reasoning.

The question that the executive faced (should I invest in Ford stock?) was difficult, but the answer to an easier and related question (do I like Ford cars?) came readily to his mind and determined his choice. This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.

The distinction between fast and slow thinking has been explored by many psychologists over the last twenty-five years. For reasons that I explain more fully in the next chapter, I describe mental life by the metaphor of two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking. I speak of the features of intuitive and deliberate thought as if they were traits and dispositions of two characters in your mind. In the picture that emerges from recent research, the intuitive System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make. Most of this book is about the workings of System 1 and the mutual influences between it and System 2.

You cannot refrain from understanding simple sentences in your own language or from orienting to a loud unexpected sound, nor can you prevent yourself from knowing that 2 + 2 = 4 or from thinking of Paris when the capital of France is mentioned. Other activities, such as chewing, are susceptible to voluntary control but normally run on automatic pilot. The control of attention is shared by the two systems. Orienting to a loud sound is normally an involuntary operation of System 1, which immediately mobilizes the voluntary attention of System 2. You may be able to resist turning toward the source of a loud and offensive comment at a crowded party, but even if your head does not move, your attention is initially directed to it, at least for a while. However, attention can be moved away from an unwanted focus, primarily by focusing intently on another target.

The often-used phrase “pay attention” is apt: you dispose of a limited budget of attention that you can allocate to activities, and if you try to go beyond your budget, you will fail. It is the mark of effortful activities that they interfere with each other, which is why it is difficult or impossible to conduct several at once. You could not compute the product of 17 × 24 while making a left turn into dense traffic, and you certainly should not try. You can do several things at once, but only if they are easy and undemanding. You are probably safe carrying on a conversation with a passenger while driving on an empty highway, and many parents have discovered, perhaps with some guilt, that they can read a story to a child while thinking of something else.

When the driver of a car is overtaking a truck on a narrow road, for example, adult passengers quite sensibly stop talking. They know that distracting the driver is not a good idea, and they also suspect that he is temporarily deaf and will not hear what they say.

Intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind, even to stimuli that normally attract attention. The most dramatic demonstration was offered by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons in their book The Invisible Gorilla. They constructed a short film of two teams passing basketballs, one team wearing white shirts, the other wearing black. The viewers of the film are instructed to count the number of passes made by the white team, ignoring the black players. This task is difficult and completely absorbing. Halfway through the video, a woman wearing a gorilla suit appears, crosses the court, thumps her chest, and moves on. The gorilla is in view for 9 seconds. Many thousands of people have seen the video, and about half of them do not notice anything unusual. It is the counting task—and especially the instruction to ignore one of the teams—that causes the blindness. No one who watches the video without that task would miss the gorilla. Seeing and orienting are automatic functions of System 1, but they depend on the allocation of some attention to the relevant stimulus. The authors note that the most remarkable observation of their study is that people find its results very surprising. Indeed, the viewers who fail to see the gorilla are initially sure that it was not there—they cannot imagine missing such a striking event. The gorilla study illustrates two important facts about our minds: we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.

Now that you have measured the lines, you—your System 2, the conscious being you call “I”—have a new belief: you know that the lines are equally long. If asked about their length, you will say what you know. But you still see the bottom line as longer. You have chosen to believe the measurement, but you cannot prevent System 1 from doing its thing; you cannot decide to see the lines as equal, although you know they are. To resist the illusion, there is only one thing you can do: you must learn to mistrust your impressions of the length of lines when fins are attached to them. To implement that rule, you must be able to recognize the illusory pattern and recall what you know about it. If you can do this, you will never again be fooled by the Müller-Lyer illusion. But you will still see one line as longer than the other.

The pupil data corresponded precisely to subjective experience: longer strings reliably caused larger dilations, the transformation task compounded the effort, and the peak of pupil size coincided with maximum effort. Add-1 with four digits caused a larger dilation than the task of holding seven digits for immediate recall. Add-3, which is much more difficult, is the most demanding that I ever observed. In the first 5 seconds, the pupil dilates by about 50% of its original area and heart rate increases by about 7 beats per minute. This is as hard as people can work—they give up if more is asked of them. When we exposed our subjects to more digits than they could remember, their pupils stopped dilating or actually shrank.

Similarly, we decide what to do, but we have limited control over the effort of doing it. Suppose you are shown four digits, say, 9462, and told that your life depends on holding them in memory for 10 seconds. However much you want to live, you cannot exert as much effort in this task as you would be forced to invest to complete an Add-3 transformation on the same digits.

Accelerating beyond my strolling speed completely changes the experience of walking, because the transition to a faster walk brings about a sharp deterioration in my ability to think coherently. As I speed up, my attention is drawn with increasing frequency to the experience of walking and to the deliberate maintenance of the faster pace. My ability to bring a train of thought to a conclusion is impaired accordingly. At the highest speed I can sustain on the hills, about 14 minutes for a mile, I do not even try to think of anything else. In addition to the physical effort of moving my body rapidly along the path, a mental effort of self-control is needed to resist the urge to slow down. Self-control and deliberate thought apparently draw on the same limited budget of effort.

The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others. The psychologist who has done this remarkable research, Kathleen Vohs, has been laudably restrained in discussing the implications of her findings, leaving the task to her readers. Her experiments are profound—her findings suggest that living in a culture that surrounds us with reminders of money may shape our behavior and our attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not be proud.

When the mysterious series of ads ended, the investigators sent questionnaires to the university communities, asking for impressions of whether each of the words “means something ‘good’ or something ‘bad.’” The results were spectacular: the words that were presented more frequently were rated much more favorably than the words that had been shown only once or twice.

In order for your mind to let go of the lower-level task of trying to hang on to everything, you have to know that you have truly captured everything that might represent something you have to do or at least decide about, and that at some point in the near future you will process and review all of it.

This ocean was here long before you, I thought, and it will be here long after your small concerns are forgotten. Twitter makes you feel that the whole world is obsessed with you and your little ego—it loves you, it hates you, it’s talking about you right now. The ocean makes you feel like the world is greeting you with a soft, wet, welcoming indifference. It’s never going to argue back, no matter how loud you yell.

It was designed to see what you could do to data to make it rise and fall at faster and faster rates in ways that resembled the decline in collective attention they had been documenting. What they discovered is there is one mechanism that can make this happen every time. You just have to flood the system with more information. The more information you pump in, the less time people can focus on any individual piece of it.

One of the leading experts on this topic is Guy Claxton, professor of learning sciences at the University of Winchester, who I went to interview in Sussex, in England. He has analyzed what happens to a person’s focus if they engage in deliberately slow practices, like yoga, or tai chi, or meditation, as discovered in a broad range of scientific studies, and he has shown they improve your ability to pay attention by a significant amount. I asked him why. He said that “we have to shrink the world to fit our cognitive bandwidth.” If you go too fast, you overload your abilities, and they degrade. But when you practice moving at a speed that is compatible with human nature—and you build that into your daily life—you begin to train your attention and focus. “That’s why those disciplines make you smarter. It’s not about humming or wearing orange robes.” Slowness, he explained, nurtures attention, and speed shatters it.

By the end of the summer, I was able to be silent for an hour, and to stand on my head. Afterward, sometimes with Stefan’s guidance, I would meditate for twenty minutes—a practice I had tried at various points in my life but always let lapse. I felt a kind of slowness spreading through my body. I felt my heartbeat slow down, and my shoulders—which are normally in a kind of permanent hunch—relax gently. But even when I felt the physical relief from this slowness, it was always followed by a kind of bubbling guilt. I thought, How can I explain this to my sped-up, stressed-out friends back home? How can we all change our lives so we feel more like this? How do you slow down in a world that is speeding up?

Some scientists used to side with my initial gut instinct—they believed it was possible for people to do several complex tasks at once. So they started to get people into labs, and they told them to do lots of things at the same time, and they monitored how well it went. What the scientists discovered is that, in fact, when people think they’re doing several things at once, they’re actually—as Earl explained—“juggling. They’re switching back and forth. They don’t notice the switching because their brain sort of papers it over, to give a seamless experience of consciousness, but what they’re actually doing is switching and reconfiguring their brain moment to moment, task to task—[and] that comes with a cost.” There are three ways, he explained, in which this constant switching degrades your ability to focus. The first is called the “switch cost effect.” There is broad scientific evidence for this. Imagine you are doing your tax return and you receive a text, and you look at it—it’s only a glance, taking five seconds—and then you go back to your tax return. In that moment, “your brain has to reconfigure, when it goes from one task to another,” he said. You have to remember what you were doing before, and you have to remember what you thought about it, “and that takes a little bit of time.” When this happens, the evidence shows that “your performance drops. You’re slower. All as a result of the switching.” So if you check your texts often while trying to work, you aren’t only losing the little bursts of time you spend looking at the texts—you are also losing the time it takes to refocus afterward, which can be much longer. He said: “If you’re spending a lot of your time not really thinking, but wasting it on switching, that’s just wasted brain-processing time.” This means that if your Screen Time shows you are using your phone four hours a day, you are losing much more time than that in lost focus.

From there, the research shows, it gets worse. The second way switching harms your attention is what we might call the “screw-up effect.” When you switch between tasks, errors that wouldn’t have happened otherwise start to creep in, because—Earl explained—“your brain is error-prone. When you switch from task to task, your brain has to backtrack a little bit and pick up and figure out where it left off”—and it can’t do that perfectly. Glitches start to occur. “Instead of spending critical time really doing deep thinking, your thinking is more superficial, because you’re spending a lot of time correcting errors and backtracking.”

Then there’s a third cost to believing you can multitask, one that you’ll only notice in the medium or longer term—which we might call the “creativity drain.” You’re likely to be significantly less creative. Why? “Because where do new thoughts [and] innovation come from?” Earl asked. They come from your brain shaping new connections out of what you’ve seen and heard and learned. Your mind, given free undistracted time, will automatically think back over everything it absorbed, and it will start to draw links between them in new ways. This all takes place beneath the level of your conscious mind, but this process is how “new ideas pop together, and suddenly, two thoughts that you didn’t think had a relationship suddenly have a relationship.” A new idea is born. But if you “spend a lot of this brain-processing time switching and error-correcting,” Earl explained, you are simply giving your brain less opportunity to “follow your associative links down to new places and really [have] truly original and creative thoughts.”

So if you spend your time switching a lot, then the evidence suggests you will be slower, you’ll make more mistakes, you’ll be less creative, and you’ll remember less of what you do. I wanted to know: How often are most of us engaging in switching like this? Professor Gloria Mark, at the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, who I interviewed, has discovered that the average American worker is distracted roughly once every three minutes. Several other studies have shown a large chunk of Americans are almost constantly being interrupted and switching between tasks. The average office worker now spends 40 percent of their work time wrongly believing they are “multitasking”—which means they are incurring all these costs for their attention and focus. In fact, uninterrupted time is becoming rare. One study found that most of us working in offices never get a whole hour uninterrupted in a normal day. I had to look again at that figure several times before I really absorbed it: most office workers never get an hour to themselves without being interrupted. This is happening at every level of businesses—the average CEO of a Fortune 500 company, for example, gets just twenty-eight uninterrupted minutes a day.

“The brain is like a muscle. The more you use certain things, the stronger the connection’s getting, and the better things work.” If you are struggling to focus, he said, just try monotasking for ten minutes, and then allow yourself to be distracted for a minute, then monotask for another ten minutes, and so on. “As you do it, it becomes more familiar, your brain gets better and better at it, because you’re strengthening the [neural] connections involved in that behavior. And pretty soon you can do it for fifteen minutes, twenty minutes, half an hour, you know?…Just do it. Practice at it…. Start slow, but practice, and you’ll get there.”

I felt like everywhere I went, I was surrounded by people who were broadcasting but not receiving. Narcissism, it occurred to me, is a corruption of attention—it’s where your attention becomes turned in only on yourself and your own ego. I don’t say this with any sense of superiority. I am embarrassed to describe what I realized in that week that I missed most about the web. Every day in my normal life—sometimes several times a day—I would look at Twitter and Instagram to see how many followers I had. I didn’t look at the feed, the news, the buzz—just my own stats. If the figure had gone up, I felt glad—like a money-obsessed miser checking the state of his personal stocks and finding he was slightly richer than yesterday. It was as if I was saying to myself, See? More people are following you. You matter. I didn’t miss the content of what they said. I just missed the raw numbers, and the sense that they were growing.

Skinner became convinced that this principle explained human behavior almost in its entirety. You believe that you are free, and that you make choices, and you have a complex human mind that is selecting what to pay attention to—but it’s all a myth. You and your sense of focus are simply the sum total of all the reinforcements you have experienced in your life. Human beings, he believed, have no minds—not in the sense that you are a person with free will making your own choices. You can be reprogrammed in any way that a clever designer wants. Years later, the designers of Instagram asked: If we reinforce our users for taking selfies—if we give them hearts and likes—will they start to do it obsessively, just like the pigeon will obsessively hold out its left wing to get extra seed? They took Skinner’s core techniques, and applied them to a billion people.

you move up to keep the flow going.” Mihaly began to wonder if these people were in fact describing a fundamental human instinct that had not been studied by scientists before. He called it a “flow state.” This is when you are so absorbed in what you are doing that you lose all sense of yourself, and time seems to fall away, and you are flowing into the experience itself. It is the deepest form of focus and attention that we know of. When he began to explain to people what a flow state is and asked if they had ever experienced something like it, 85 percent of them recognized and remembered at least one time they’d felt this way—and they often said these moments were the highlights of their lives.

The first thing you need to do is to choose a clearly defined goal. I want to paint this canvas; I want to run up this hill; I want to teach my child how to swim. You have to resolve to pursue it, and to set aside your other goals while you do. Flow can only come when you are monotasking—when you choose to set aside everything else and do one thing. Mihaly found that distraction and multitasking kill flow, and nobody will reach flow if they are trying to do two or more things at the same time. Flow requires all of your brainpower, deployed toward one mission. Second, you have to be doing something that is meaningful to you. This is part of a basic truth about attention: we evolved to pay attention to things that are meaningful to us. As Roy Baumeister, the leading expert on willpower I quoted in the introduction, put it to me: “A frog will look at a fly it can eat much more than a stone it can’t eat.” To a frog, a fly is meaningful and a stone is not—so it easily pays attention to a fly, and rarely pays attention to a stone. This, he said, “goes back to the design of the brain…. It’s designed to pay attention to the stuff that matters to you.” After all, “the frog who sat around all day looking at stones would have starved.” In any situation, it will be easier to pay attention to things that are meaningful to you, and harder to pay attention to things that seem meaningless. When you are trying to make yourself do something that lacks meaning, your attention will often slip and slide off it. Third, it will help if you are doing something that is at the edge of your abilities, but not beyond them. If the goal you choose is too easy, you’ll go into autopilot—but if it’s too hard, you’ll start to feel anxious and off-kilter and you won’t flow either. Picture a rock climber who has medium-ranking experience and talent. If she clambers up any old brick wall at the back of a garden, she’s not going to get into flow because it’s too easy. If she’s suddenly told to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, she won’t get into flow either because she’ll freak out. What she needs is a hill or mountain that is, ideally, slightly higher and harder than the one she did last time. So, to find flow, you need to choose one single goal; make sure your goal is meaningful to you; and try to push yourself to the edge of your abilities.

I noticed that if I spent a day where I experienced three hours of flow early on, for the rest of the day, I felt relaxed and open and able to engage—to walk along the beach, or start chatting to people, or read a book, without feeling cramped, or irritable, or phone-hungry. It was like the flow was relaxing my body and opening my mind—perhaps because I knew I had done my best. I felt myself falling into a different rhythm. I realized then that to recover from our loss of attention, it is not enough to strip out our distractions. That will just create a void. We need to strip out our distractions and to replace them with sources of flow.

Throughout the day, in your brain, a chemical called adenosine is building up, and it signals to you when you are sleepy. Caffeine blocks the receptor that picks up on the level of adenosine. “I liken it to putting a Post-it note over your fuel-gauge indicator. You’re not giving yourself more energy—you’re just not realizing how empty you are. When the caffeine wears off, you’re doubly exhausted.”

But Roxanne told me bluntly: “If you chemically induce sleep, it’s not the same kind of sleep.” Remember—sleep is an active process, in which your brain and body do lots of things. Many of these things don’t happen, or happen far less, in drugged or drunk sleep. The different ways of artificially inducing sleep can have different effects. If you take five milligrams of melatonin—which is often a standard dose that’s sold over the counter in the U.S.—Roxanne said you risk “blowing out your melatonin receptors,” which would make it harder to sleep without them.

In a society dominated by the values of consumer capitalism, “sleep is a big problem,” he told me. “If you’re asleep, you’re not spending money, so you’re not consuming anything. You’re not producing any products.” He explained that “during the last recession [in 2008]…they talked about global output going down by so many percent, and consumption going down. But if everybody were to spend [an] extra hour sleeping [as they did in the past], they wouldn’t be on Amazon. They wouldn’t be buying things.” If we went back to sleeping a healthy amount—if everyone did what I did in Provincetown—Charles said, “it would be an earthquake for our economic system, because our economic system has become dependent on sleep-depriving people. The attentional failures are just roadkill. That’s just the cost of doing business.” I only really understood how significant this point was toward the end of writing this book.

We also need, all the sleep experts told me, to have different relationships with our phones. Roxanne told me that to lots of us, “it’s like your baby, right? So as a new parent, you’re like—I’ve got to be vigilant for this thing. I’ve got to pay attention. I’m not sleeping as deeply. Or you are like a firefighter who’s listening for a call.” We’re constantly a little tensed to see: “Did something happen?” She says your phone should always recharge overnight in a different room, where you can’t see or hear it. Then you need to make sure your room is the right temperature—it should be cool, almost cold. This is because your body needs to cool its core to send you to sleep, and the harder that is, the longer it takes.

What, I wondered, is the message buried in the medium of the printed book? Before the words convey their specific meaning, the medium of the book tells us several things. Firstly, life is complex, and if you want to understand it, you have to set aside a fair bit of time to think deeply about it. You need to slow down. Secondly, there is a value in leaving behind your other concerns and narrowing down your attention to one thing, sentence after sentence, page after page. Thirdly, it is worth thinking deeply about how other people live and how their minds work. They have complex inner lives just like you.

When they got the results, they were clear. The more novels you read, the better you were at reading other people’s emotions. It was a huge effect. This wasn’t just a sign that you were better educated—because reading nonfiction books, by contrast, had no effect on your empathy. I asked Raymond why. Reading, he told me, creates a “unique form of consciousness…. While we’re reading, we’re directing attention outward toward the words on the page and, at the same time, enormous amounts of attention is going inward as we imagine and mentally simulate.” It’s different from if you just close your eyes and try to imagine something off the top of your head. “It’s being structured—but our attention is in a very unique place, fluctuating both out toward the page, toward the words, and then inward, toward what those words represent.” It’s a way of combining “outwardly directed attention and inwardly directed attention.” When you read fiction in particular, you imagine what it is like to be another person. You find yourself, he says, “trying to understand the different characters, their motivations, their goals, tracking those different things. It’s a form of practice. We’re probably using the same kinds of cognitive processes that we would use to understand our real peers in the real world.” You simulate being another human so well that fiction is a far better virtual reality simulator than the machines currently marketed under that name.

The effects he is describing aren’t to do primarily with the printed page, he said—they are to do with being immersed in a complex narrative that simulates the social world. His studies have found that long TV series are just as effective, he said. But there’s a catch. One of his studies showed that children are more empathetic if they read storybooks or watch movies, but not if they watch shorter shows. This appears to fit, it seemed to me, with what we see on social media—if you see the world through fragments, your empathy often doesn’t kick in, in the way that it does when you engage with something in a sustained, focused way.

“Creativity is not [where you create] some new thing that’s emerged from your brain,” Nathan told me. “It’s a new association between two things that were already there.” Mind-wandering allows “more extended trains of thought to unfold, which allows for more associations to be made.” Henri Poincaré couldn’t have come up with his solution if he had remained narrowly focused on the math problem he was trying to solve, or if he had been totally distracted.

three crucial things that are happening during mind-wandering. First, you are slowly making sense of the world. Jonathan gave me an example. When you read a book—as you are doing now—you obviously focus on the individual words and sentences, but there’s always a little bit of your mind that is wandering. You are thinking about how these words relate to your own life. You are thinking about how these sentences relate to what I said in previous chapters. You are thinking about what I might say next. You are wondering if what I am saying is full of contradictions, or whether it will all come together in the end. Suddenly you picture a memory from your childhood, or from what you saw on TV last week. “You draw together the different parts of the book in order to make sense of the key theme,” he said. This isn’t a flaw in your reading. This is reading.

Second, when your mind wanders, it starts to make new connections between things—which often produces solutions to your problems. As Nathan put it to me, “I think what’s happening is that, when there’s unresolved issues, the brain tries to make things fit,” if it’s just given the space to do it.

Third, during mind-wandering, your mind will—Nathan said—engage in “mental time-travel,” where it roams over the past and tries to predict the future. Freed from the pressures of thinking narrowly about what’s right in front of you, your mind will start to think about what might come next—and so it will help to prepare you for it.

But Nathan—after studying all this—had found that to be productive, you can’t aim simply to narrow your spotlight as much as possible. He said: “I try to go for a walk every day and just let my mind kind of sort things out…. I don’t think our full conscious control of our thoughts is necessarily our most productive way of thinking. I think loose patterns of association can lead to unique insight.” Marcus agreed. Focusing on what’s right in front of you, he told me, gives you “some of the raw material that has to be digested, but at some point, you need to stand back from that.” He warned: “If we’re just frantically running around focusing on the external world exclusively, we miss the opportunity to let the brain digest what’s been going on.”

For example, Sean Parker, one of the earliest investors in Facebook, told a public audience that the creators of the site had asked themselves from the start: “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?” The techniques they used were “exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology….

And we did it anyway.” He added: “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” Chamath Palihapitiya, who had been Facebook’s vice president of growth, explained in a speech that the effects are so negative that his own kids “aren’t allowed to use that shit.” Tony Fadell, who co-invented the iPhone, said: “I wake up in cold sweats every so often thinking, what did we bring to the world?” He worried that he had helped create “a nuclear bomb” that can “blow up people’s brains and reprogram them.”

They’re reassembling all that metadata you don’t really think is meaningful, so that doll looks more and more like you. [Then] when you show up on [for example] YouTube, they’re waking up that doll, and they’re testing out hundreds of thousands of videos against this doll, seeing what makes its arm twitch and move, so they know it’s effective, and then they serve that to you.” It seemed like such a ghoulish image that I paused.

It was explained to me that whenever something is provided by a tech company for free, it’s always to improve the voodoo doll. Why is Google Maps free? So the voodoo doll can include the details of where you go every day. Why are Amazon Echo and Google Nest Hubs sold for as cheap at $30, far less than they cost to make? So they can gather more info; so the voodoo doll can consist not just of what you search for on a screen but what you say in your home.

Imagine two Facebook feeds. One is full of updates, news, and videos that make you feel calm and happy. The other is full of updates, news, and videos that make you feel angry and outraged. Which one does the algorithm select? The algorithm is neutral about the question of whether it wants you to be calm or angry. That’s not its concern. It only cares about one thing: Will you keep scrolling? Unfortunately, there’s a quirk of human behavior. On average, we will stare at something negative and outrageous for a lot longer than we will stare at something positive and calm. You will stare at a car crash longer than you will stare at a person handing out flowers by the side of the road, even though the flowers will give you a lot more pleasure than the mangled bodies in a crash. Scientists have been proving this effect in different contexts for a long time—if they showed you a photo of a crowd, and some of the people in it were happy, and some angry, you would instinctively pick out the angry faces first. Even ten-week-old babies respond differently to angry faces. This has been known about in psychology for years and is based on a broad body of evidence. It’s called “negativity bias.”

The average young person is soaking up filth like this day after day. Do those feelings of anger go away when they put down their phone? The evidence suggests that for lots of people, they don’t. A major study asked white nationalists how they became radicalized, and a majority named the internet—with YouTube as the site that most influenced them. A separate study of far-right people on Twitter found that YouTube was by far the website they turned to the most. “Just watching YouTube radicalizes people,” Tristan explained. Companies like YouTube want us to think “we have a few bad apples,” he explained to the journalist Decca Aitkenhead, but they don’t want us to ask: “Do we have a system that is systematically, as you turn the crank every day, pumping out more radicalization? We’re growing bad apples. We’re a bad-apple factory. We’re a bad-apple farm.”

But at the same time as the web was having this positive effect, the social-media algorithms were having the opposite effect—they were supercharging anti-democratic forces in Brazil. A former military officer named Jair Bolsonaro had been a marginal figure for years. He was way outside the mainstream because he kept saying vile things and attacking large parts of the population in extreme ways. He praised people who had carried out torture against innocent people when Brazil was a dictatorship. He told his female colleagues in the senate that they were so ugly he wouldn’t bother raping them, and that they weren’t “worthy” of it. He said he would rather learn his son was dead than learn his son was gay. Then YouTube and Facebook became one of the main ways people in Brazil got their news. Their algorithms prioritized angry, outrageous content—and Bolsonaro’s reach dramatically surged. He became a social-media star. He ran for president openly attacking people like the residents of Alemão, saying the country’s poorer, blacker citizens “are not even good for breeding,” and should “go back to the zoo.” He promised to give the police even more power to launch intensified military attacks on the favelas—a license for wholesale slaughter. Here was a society with huge problems that urgently needed to be solved—but social-media algorithms were promoting far-right-wingers and wild disinformation. In the run-up to the election, in favelas like Alemão, many people were deeply worried about a story that had been circulating online. Supporters of Bolsonaro had created a video warning that his main rival, Fernando Haddad, wanted to turn all the children of Brazil into homosexuals, and that he had developed a cunning technique to do it. The video showed a baby sucking a bottle, only there was something peculiar about it—the teat of the bottle had been painted to look like a penis. This, the story that circulated said, is what Haddad will distribute to every kindergarten in Brazil. This became one of the most-shared news stories in the entire election. People in the favelas explained indignantly that they couldn’t possibly vote for somebody who wanted to get babies to suck these penis-teats, and so they would have to vote for Bolsonaro instead. On these algorithm-pumped absurdities, the fate of the whole country turned.

This machinery is systematically diverting us—at an individual and a social level—from where we want to go. James Williams, the former Google strategist, said to me we should imagine “if we had a GPS and it worked fine the first time. But the next time, it took you a few streets away from where you wanted to go. And then later, it took you to a different town.” All because the advertisers who funded GPS had paid for this to happen. “You would never keep using that.” But social media works exactly this way. There’s a “destination we want to get to, and most of the time, it doesn’t actually get us there—it takes us off track. If it was actually navigating us not through informational space but through physical space, we would never keep using it. It would be, by definition, defective.”

“An internal trigger is an uncomfortable emotional state,” he told me. “It’s all about avoidance. It’s all about—how do I get out of this uncomfortable state?” He believes we all need to explore our triggers nonjudgmentally, think about them, and find ways to disrupt them. So whenever he felt that prickling feeling or boredom or stress come to him, he identified what was happening, and picked up a pack of Post-it notes, and he wrote on it what he wanted to know. Later, when he had finished a good stretch of writing, he would let himself google it—but only then. It worked for him. This taught Nir that “we’re not beholden to habits. They can be interrupted. They get interrupted all the time. We can change habits. The way we change a habit is by understanding what the internal trigger is, and making sure that there’s some kind of break between the impulse to do a behavior and the behavior itself.”

My unease about this approach only became clear to me when I turned to the book Nir wrote a few years before he produced his work about how to beat distraction. It was written for an audience of tech designers and engineers, and it was named Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products. He described it as a “cookbook” containing “a recipe for human behavior.” Reading Hooked as an ordinary user of the internet is strange—it’s like the moment in an old Batman movie when the villain is caught and reveals everything he did all along, step by step. Nir writes: “Let’s admit it: we are all in the persuasion business. Innovators build products meant to persuade people to do what we want them to do. We call these people users and even if we don’t say it aloud, we secretly wish every one of them would become fiendishly hooked to whatever we’re making.” He lays out the methods to achieve this, which he describes as “mind manipulation.” The goal, Nir says, is to “create a craving” in human beings—and he cites B. F. Skinner as a model for how to do it. His approach can be summarized by the headline on one of his blog posts: “Want to Hook Your Users? Drive Them Crazy.”

I understood my growing discomfort with Nir’s approach more fully when I talked it over with several other people. One was Ronald Purser, who is professor of management at San Francisco State University. He introduced me to an idea I hadn’t heard before—a concept named “cruel optimism.” This is when you take a really big problem with deep causes in our culture—like obesity, or depression, or addiction—and you offer people, in upbeat language, a simplistic individual solution. It sounds optimistic, because you are telling them that the problem can be solved, and soon—but it is, in fact, cruel, because the solution you are offering is so limited, and so blind to the deeper causes, that for most people, it will fail. Ronald gave lots of examples of this idea, which was first coined by the historian Lauren Berlant. I started to really grasp this idea when he applied this concept to one that’s related to attention but separate from it—stress. I think it’s worth taking a little time to go through it, because I believe it can help us see a mistake that Nir—like many of us—is making when it comes to focus. Ronald talked to me about a bestselling book by a New York Times reporter that tells its readers: “Stress isn’t something imposed on us. It’s something we impose on ourselves.” Stress is a feeling. Stress is a series of thoughts. If you just learn how to think differently—to quiet down your rattling thoughts—your stress will melt away. So you just need to learn to meditate. Your stress comes from a failure to be mindful. This message sings off the page with optimistic promise—but Ronald points out that in the real world, the top causes of stress in the U.S. have been identified by scientists at Stanford Graduate School of Business in a major study. They are “a lack of health insurance, the constant threat of lay-offs, lack of discretion and autonomy in decision-making, long working hours, low levels of organizational justice, and unrealistic demands.” If you don’t have health insurance and you have diabetes and you can’t afford insulin, or if you are forced to work sixty hours a week by a bullying boss, or if you are watching your colleagues get laid off one by one and you suspect with a sickening feeling that you will be next, your stress is not “something we impose on ourselves.” It is something imposed on you.

As he said this, I thought about Nir again, and the wider Silicon Valley approach he exemplifies. He makes his living from marketing and promoting a digital model that “hooks” us and plays on our fears and that even he says is designed to make us “crazy.” That model, in turn, hooked him. But because he is in a position of incredible privilege—in terms of wealth, and knowledge of these systems—he was able to use his own techniques to regain some sense of control. Now he thinks the solution is simply for all of us to do the same.

That’s why, one morning, Aza said to me starkly: “We could just ban surveillance capitalism.” I paused to try to process what he was saying. This would mean, he explained, that the government would ban any business model that tracks you online in order to figure out your weaknesses and then sells that private data to the highest bidder so they can change your behavior. This model is, Aza says, “just fundamentally anti-democratic and anti-human,” and it has to go. This sounded dramatic and frankly impossible when I first heard it, but Tristan and Aza explained that there are plenty of historical precedents for something becoming so widespread, only for society to discover it actually causes a lot of harm and ban the market in it. Think about lead paint. It was in a majority of American homes—then it was discovered to damage the brains of kids and adults, making it harder for them to focus. As one of Tristan’s mentors, Jaron Lanier, pointed out to me, when we found that out, we didn’t say nobody could paint their homes ever again. We just banned the lead in the paint. Your home is still painted today—just with much better products.

Once the financial incentives are changed—either through subscription, or public ownership, or another model—then the nature of these sites can change, in ways we can actually begin to envision already. Aza told me that “it’s actually technically not hard” to redesign the major social-media sites so that, instead of trashing your attention span and our societies, they would be designed to heal them, once the financial incentives to do that are in place. This was difficult for me to grasp at first, so I asked what social media would look like after the changes they would like to see. Tristan, Aza, and others began by explaining minor changes, then built up to big changes, then told me what has to occur to make any of these changes happen. They started by talking about how these companies could, overnight, remove a lot of the aspects of these apps and sites that deliberately scramble our heads and keep us online longer than we really want. Aza said: “For instance, Facebook tomorrow could start batching your notifications, so you only get one push notification a day…. They could do that tomorrow.” (This was something Tristan had proposed in his explosive slide-deck back when he was still at Google.) So instead of getting “this constant drip of behavioral cocaine,” telling you every few minutes that somebody liked your picture, commented on your post, has a birthday tomorrow, and on and on and on—you would get one daily update, like a newspaper, summarizing it all. You’d be pushed to look once a day, instead of being interrupted several times an hour. “Here’s another one,” he said. “Infinite scroll.” That’s his invention, where when you get to the bottom of the screen, it automatically loads more and more, forever. “What’s going on there is it’s catching your impulses before your brain has a chance to really get involved and make a decision.” Facebook and Instagram and the others could simply turn off infinite scroll—so that when you get to the bottom of the screen, you have to make a conscious decision to carry on scrolling. Similarly, these sites could simply switch off the things that have been shown to most polarize people politically, stealing our ability to pay collective attention. Since there’s evidence YouTube’s recommendation engine is radicalizing people, Tristan told one interviewer: “Just turn it off. They can turn it off in a heartbeat.” It’s not as if, he points out, the day before recommendations were introduced, people were lost and clamoring for somebody to tell them what to watch next.

After carefully analyzing all the options, Facebook’s scientists concluded there was one solution: they said Facebook would have to abandon its current business model. Because their growth was so tied up with toxic outcomes, the company should abandon attempts at growth. The only way out was for the company to adopt a strategy that was “anti-growth”—deliberately shrink, and choose to be a less wealthy company that wasn’t wrecking the world. Once Facebook was shown—in plain language, by their own people—what they were doing, how did the company’s executives respond? According to the Journal’s in-depth reporting, they mocked the research, calling it an “Eat Your Veggies” approach. They introduced some minor tweaks, but dismissed most of the recommendations. The Common Ground team was disbanded and has ceased to exist.

There are, of course, many differences between the fight for feminism and the fight for our focus. But nonetheless, I kept returning to this example in my mind for a very basic reason. The feminist movement teaches us that huge and seemingly immovable forces can be challenged by ordinary people—and that when they are, it can lead to real change.

Now imagine that these bear attacks happen a lot. Imagine if three times a week, an angry bear suddenly appeared on your street and swiped one of your neighbors. If this happened, you would likely develop a state known as “hypervigilance.” You would start to look out for danger all the time—whether there’s a bear right in front of you or not. Nadine explained to me: “Hypervigilance is essentially when you’re looking out for the bear around every corner. Your attention is focused on cues for potential danger, as opposed to being focused on being present with what’s going on, or the lesson you’re supposed to be learning, or doing the work you were supposed to be doing. It’s not that [people in this state are] not paying attention. It’s that they’re paying attention to any cues or signs of threat or danger in their environment. That is where their focus is.”

She believed she had uncovered a key truth about focus: To pay attention in normal ways, you need to feel safe. You need to be able to switch off the parts of your mind that are scanning the horizon for bears or lions or their modern equivalents, and let yourself sink down into one secure topic. In Adelaide, in Australia, I met with a child psychiatrist named Dr. Jon Jureidini, who has specialized in this question, and he told me that narrowing your focus is “a really good strategy in a safe environment, because it means you can learn things and flourish and develop. But if you are in a dangerous environment, selective attention [where you focus on just one thing] is a really dumb strategy. What you need instead is to evenly spread vigilance around your environment, looking for cues for danger.”

If a child is having horrific behavior, most of the time, it’s the child’s really great way of alerting the system that something is not right.” She came to believe that when children can’t pay attention, that’s often a signal that they are under terrible stress. Jon, the doctor in Adelaide who specialized in this subject, told me: “If you’re medicating a child in that situation, you’re colluding with them remaining in a violent or unacceptable situation.”

Think about the weekend, which for more than a hundred years gave most workers a guaranteed slice of rest and reflection. How did that come to pass? In the eighteenth century, as the Industrial Revolution surged, many workers found themselves forced by their employers to work for ten hours a day, six days a week. It was breaking them, physically and mentally. So they began to band together and demanded time to live. The first strike demanding shorter working hours took place in Philadelphia in 1791. The police beat the workers to a pulp, and afterward, many of them were fired. But the workers didn’t give up. They fought harder. By 1835 they were organizing a general strike for an eight-hour day. Only decades of campaigns like this finally yielded an eight-hour day and a weekend for almost everyone.

This insight is connected to another big obstacle to achieving this goal. A four-day week can be applied to salaried workers—but increasingly, many people are being forced into the “gig economy,” where they scramble to do several jobs without any contracts or fixed work hours at all. This is happening as a result of a very specific change: in countries like the U.S. and Britain, governments broke up and largely destroyed labor unions. They made it harder and harder for workers to band together and demand things like contracts and fixed work hours. The only long-term solution to this is to steadily rebuild unions—so people have the power to demand these basic rights. This has already begun. For example, all over the U.S., workers in fast-food restaurants are unionizing and demanding a $15 minimum wage per hour, with incredible success. They have secured wage raises for over 22 million workers and have pulled off the difficult job of winning majority support both in states that voted for Donald Trump and in states that voted for Joe Biden.

But this was a small study—so the same team decided to follow up. This time, they took a hundred children, and they did the experiment again, following kids over five weeks. Once again, it turned out that most of the kids who stuck to the eliminationist diet saw a big improvement in their attention and focus, and more than half got dramatically better.

The evidence for this was strong and decisive enough that in the aftermath of this discovery, many European countries banned these dyes—but the U.S. regulators refused to, and they are still being consumed every day in some of the country’s most popular cereals and snacks.

That’s the magic bullet—just go back to whole foods. Foods as they were originally intended.” He quoted Michael Pollan, who says we should eat only food that our grandparents would have recognized as food, and we should shop primarily around the outer edges of the supermarket—the fruit and veg at the front, and the meat and fish at the back. The stuff in the middle, he warned, isn’t really food at all.

Yet I can imagine presenting this evidence to people in a way that reeks of cruel optimism. You can picture Instagram influencers taking these points and posting: Look! Just change what you eat and your focus will return! I did it! Now you can too! But the truth is that this—like so much of what I was learning about for this book—is primarily a structural problem. Nobody I know has a mountain and a farm like my grandparents did—they have to get their food at supermarkets. Those supermarkets are full of cheap processed food, which is promoted to us from the moment we are born by enormous advertising budgets. If we are going to overcome this problem, there is some role for each of us making individual changes, but there’s a bigger need to deal with the larger forces behind it. Today, just like—as Tristan had taught me—every time you try to put down your phone, there are a thousand engineers behind the screen trying to get you to pick it up again, every time you try to give up processed food, there’s a team of expert marketers trying to get you to crack and come back to it. From long before you were even consciously aware of it, they have been working at getting you to associate positive feelings with unhealthy food. They programmed me perfectly to feed their profit margins rather than my brain health, and I’m not alone. That machinery needs to be turned off, so it can’t distort the tastes and steal the focus of another generation.

There was always a non-leaded form of gasoline available that didn’t carry these risks, but the big corporations resisted it fiercely, seemingly for a commercial reason: they could patent the leaded version, and so make more money from it.

Bruce and other scientists showed that lead severely stunts your ability to focus and pay attention. If you are exposed to lead as a child, he explained to me, you are “two and a half times more likely to meet criteria for ADHD.” The effect becomes even bigger if it is combined with other forms of pollution. For example, if your mother was exposed to lead during pregnancy and she smoked cigarettes, you are eight times more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. Before Bruce arrived, the mothers of Rochester—like mothers across the United States—had been warned about the dangers of lead poisoning, and then told that it was their fault. The authorities said to them: Your kids are being exposed in this way because, as mothers, you have failed to dust your homes enough. Do more housework and get your kids to wash their hands more. This was part of a wider push. The lead industry itself claimed the problem lay mainly with “uneducable Negro and Puerto Rican” parents who “failed” to protect their kids from the lead in their homes. But when Bruce studied it, he found that all this dusting and handwashing made no difference at all. He could see that a whole city, and a whole generation of children, had been poisoned, and the families had been told it was on them because they weren’t clean enough. Some scientists went even further in blaming the victims. They said the problem wasn’t that the families were living with high levels of a brain-damaging metal, but that the children had a mental illness. They said the kids had a psychological disorder named “pica,” which was making toddlers irrationally stick chunks of lead paint in their mouths. These children were labeled as having a “perverted appetite,” and it was (again) claimed that this problem seemed to be suffered mainly by Black and Brown children.

It sometimes seems like the same story that played out with lead is now happening with other attention-damaging chemicals. The industries that profit from using them fund the vast majority of the research into them; they systematically promote doubt about the possible harms; and they argue that if there’s any doubt at all about the danger of their products, they should be allowed to carry on using them.

But I want to make clear a few things at the start that every expert I spoke with agreed on: Everyone being diagnosed with ADHD has a real problem. They aren’t making it up or faking it. Whatever the cause, if you or your child is struggling to focus, it’s not your fault; you’re not incompetent or undisciplined or any of the other stigmatizing labels that might have been applied to you. You deserve compassion and practical help to find solutions. Most experts believed that for some children, there can be a biological contribution to their poor focus—though they disagreed on how large a contribution that is. We should be able to have a calm and honest conversation about the other aspects of the ADHD controversy while holding these truths in our minds.

As all this has exploded, a polarized argument has broken out over it. On one side, there are people saying ADHD is a disorder caused overwhelmingly by something going wrong within the individual’s genes and brain, and that very large numbers of children and adults should be taking these stimulants to treat it. This side has largely prevailed in the U.S. On the other side, there are people saying that attention problems are real and painful, but it is incorrect and harmful to see them as a biological disorder that requires the mass prescription of drugs, and we should be offering different forms of help. This side has largely prevailed in places like Finland.

I only remember the broad details of what she said—but he had a typical experience. Years before, he had been really struggling at school—he wasn’t able to pay attention in class, and he was in trouble a lot. She felt concerned for him, and judged by the other parents. Finally, the school’s teachers urged her to take him to the doctor. Their doctor spoke to her son and then told her that he had diagnosed him with ADHD. He told her that it meant her son had different genetics from other kids, and that as a result he had developed a different kind of brain, one that wasn’t like most people’s. This meant he found it much harder to sit still and focus. Stephen Hinshaw, a professor of psychology at Stanford University, similarly told me that genetics account for “75 to 80 percent” of ADHD, a ballpark figure that is based on a large series of scientific studies. It’s distressing to be told your child has a disability. She felt shocked—but at the same time as they are offered this message, parents are also told lots of positive things: Your son’s behavior isn’t your fault. In fact, you deserve sympathy; you’ve been coping with something really hard. And best of all, there is a solution. Her son was prescribed the stimulant drug Ritalin. When he started to take it, he stopped being so restless and bouncing off the walls. He said he didn’t like how it made him feel, though—one child I know told me that he felt like his brain was turned off when he took the drug—so his mother felt genuinely conflicted. Ultimately, she decided to continue to give him the stimulant until he turned eighteen, because she felt that at least this would stop him from being thrown out of school. There’s no dramatic aspect to this story: he didn’t have a heart attack or start using meth. On balance, she thought she was doing the right thing.

Before I went to meet Nicholas, I expected him to justify this in one particular way. I thought he would tell me the story that lots of doctors tell parents who have kids with attention problems—that this is a disorder with biological causes, which is why you need biological solutions in the form of drugs. But he didn’t say that. In fact, his explanation started where his own journey into this science had begun—with cribbing horses. “No one’s ever seen a horse in the wild do this. This is a condition of ‘domestication,’ keeping horses in unnatural situations,” he told me. “If they’d never been put in a stall, and they’d never been subjected to that psychological pressure early on, they wouldn’t develop it.” As he described what happened to these horses, he used a phrase that struck me. He said these horses are suffering from “frustrated biological objectives.” Horses want to roam and run and graze. When they can’t express their innate nature, their behavior and focus go awry, and they start to act out. He told me that “the pressure of having your biological objectives thwarted is such that it opens a Pandora’s box,” where you’ll try to find any behavior that will “alleviate this crushing psychological pressure or inability to do anything…. Horses spend about 60 percent of their time in the wild grazing, so it’s not surprising that one of the things that gives them release is a sort of fake grazing, which is what cribbing is.” He admitted freely that his approach of drugging animals for what’s dubbed “zoochosis”—the madness animals often develop when they are caged—is an extremely limited solution. I asked him if, for example, drugging the polar bear had solved his problem. “No,” he replied. “It <You have reached the clipping limit for this item>

Some organizations are interested in the concept of “hotel-ing”—that is, having people create totally self-contained and mobile workstation capabilities so they can “plug in” anywhere in the company, at any time, and work from there. That can provide savings in office space requirements, as companies operate more virtually with a workforce that can function independently from the “mother ship.” But that presupposes that each worker involved has a locus of control on his or her own. Experiments have failed in this scheme, because they disrupted the stable workstation. There must be zero resistance to using the systems we have.

The biggest issue for digitally oriented people is that the ease of capturing and storing has generated a write-only syndrome: all they’re doing is capturing information—not actually accessing and using it intelligently. Some consciousness needs to be applied to keep one’s potentially huge digital library functional, versus a black hole of data easily dumped in there with a couple of keystrokes. “I don’t need to organize my stuff, because the search feature can find it sufficiently” is, from what I’ve experienced, quite suboptimal as an approach.

Today, I understand something I didn’t see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don’t want anything else in life. But you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known. Now that I have seen them, and now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I’m going to feel worse than I did before you arrived. Because I know the things I should be able to accomplish, and I don’t want to do so.”

It was the pure Language of the World. It required no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time. What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. He was more certain of it than of anything in the world. He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language. Because, when you know that language, it’s easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, whether it’s in the middle of the desert or in some great city. And when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant. There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. Without such love, one’s dreams would have no meaning.

If Marx at twenty-two had a problem, it was that he was attracted to too many things and people. Marx’s favorite adjective was “interesting.” The world seemed filled with interesting books to read, interesting plays and movies to see, interesting games to play, interesting food to taste, and interesting people to have sex with and sometimes even to fall in love with. To Marx, it seemed foolish not to love as many things as you could. In the first months she knew him, Sadie disparaged Marx to Sam by calling him “the romantic dilettante.”

This generation doesn’t hide anything from anyone. My class talks a lot about their traumas. And how their traumas inform their games.

Their standards are higher; they call bullshit on so much of the sexism and racism that I, at least, just lived with. But that’s also made them kind of, well, humorless.

The biomedical approach solved a moral problem—that patients and their families were being blamed—and it has been celebrated for its potential to reduce stigma. The surgeon general’s first-ever report on mental health, in 1999, proposed that stigma arises from “the misguided split between mind and body first proposed by Descartes.” At a press conference, the surgeon general announced that there is “no scientific justification for distinguishing between mental illness and other forms of illness.”

In an essay called “The Hidden Self,” William James writes that “the ideal of every science is that of a closed and completed system of truth.” Scholars achieve this goal, he writes, largely by neglecting what he calls the “unclassified residuum”—those symptoms and experiences that do not “wear just this ideal form.” This book is about people whose struggles with mental illness exist outside of this “closed and completed system of truth.” Their lives unfold in different eras and cultures, but they also share a setting: the psychic hinterlands, the outer edges of human experience, where language tends to fail. I have chosen subjects who have tried to overcome a feeling of incommunicability through writing; the book draws not only from conversations with them but from their diaries, letters, unpublished memoirs, poems, and prayers. They have come up against the limits of psychiatric ways of understanding themselves and are searching for the right scale of explanation—chemical, existential, cultural, economic, political—to understand a self in the world. But these different explanations are not mutually exclusive; sometimes all of them can be true.

In creating a shared language, contemporary psychiatry can alleviate people’s loneliness, but we may take for granted the impact of its explanations, which are not neutral: they alter the kinds of stories about the self that count as “insight” and how we understand our potential. Ray Osheroff, the subject of the first chapter, is trying to make sense of two conflicting models of the mind, neither of which has made his suffering legible. “Am I really this?” Ray asks. “Am I not this? What am I?”

Fromm-Reichmann described loneliness as “one of the least satisfactorily conceptualized psychological phenomena, not even mentioned in most psychiatric textbooks”—a state in which the “fact that there were people in one’s past life is more or less forgotten, and the possibility that there may be interpersonal relationships in one’s future life is out of the realm of expectation.” Loneliness was such a deep threat, she wrote, that psychiatrists avoided talking about it, because they feared they’d be contaminated by it, too. The experience was nearly impossible to communicate; it was a kind of “naked existence.”

Kuhn was skeptical of the way that other psychiatrists measured mental experiences with questionnaires, narrowing mental life to a set of symptoms. He criticized Nathan Kline for treating the brain as if it were “a machine that just runs faster or slower.” A psychiatrist, Kuhn wrote, must understand that he is “not dealing with a self-contained, rigid object, but with an individual who is involved in constant movement and change.” Sometimes, Kuhn said, after taking medications his patients realized they had been ill for much longer than they had known; they began to reassess who they had been all along.

Bhargavi was dimly aware that her mother had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but no one in her family talked about it. The label made Bhargavi feel that her mother’s experiences were foreign and impossible to comprehend. Psychiatric explanations, imported from the West, created in Bhargavi a sense of estrangement: she didn’t know how to grieve her mother’s absence. Her family, too, wasn’t sure how to communicate about why Bapu seemed to inhabit a different reality from them. Whenever her mother went through one of her “states,” as they were called, her family was silent. It was as if they had a “perceptual blackout,” Bhargavi said.

Psychiatry isn’t the only framework that has a kind of double-edged quality, offering a story that can save a person but that also, under different conditions, feels lonely and intractable. I wonder about the character of Bapu’s distress before it was classified as either mysticism or mental illness, just as I question whatever basic feelings existed in me before they were called anorexia. In each case, the original experience couldn’t be captured or understood on its own terms and gradually became something that wasn’t entirely of our own making.

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs—most prominently Prozac and Zoloft—were created in the eighties, filling a gap in the market opened by concerns that benzodiazepines were addictive. They were soon prescribed for not just depression but the anxieties that benzodiazepines had previously addressed. Now more than one in five white women in America take antidepressants. Peter Kramer, the author of Listening to Prozac, told me that the SSRIs were “eerily consonant with what the culture required of women: less fragility, more juggling outside of the home.” An early advertisement for Zoloft showed a white woman in a pantsuit, holding the hands of her two children, and the phrase “Power that speaks softly.” An ad for Prozac, which ran for two and a half years, showed another white woman, her wedding ring visible, and the slogan “For both restful nights and productive days.”

When I met Laura, I told her I may have experienced something akin to a “neuro-abortion”: a false desire to terminate a pregnancy. A 2001 paper in the Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience chronicled thirty-six women who were on either antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or a combination of the two, and who stopped their drugs abruptly when they became pregnant. A third of the patients said they felt suicidal, and four were admitted to a hospital. One had an abortion because “she did not feel that she could go through the pregnancy feeling so awful,” though the pregnancy was “otherwise wanted.” The authors didn’t follow up with this woman, but I wonder if she, too, withdrew too quickly from the medications. Once she went back on her pills, did she want her baby again, too?

“Here let me explain something about me,” I wrote in a diary when I was eight. “I had a diseas called anexexia.” Ray, Bapu, Naomi, and Laura also felt compelled to write about their illnesses, even as they realized that the language on offer wasn’t quite right. They described their psychological experiences with deep self-awareness, but they also needed others to confirm whether what they were feeling was real. It didn’t matter whether they believed they were married to God or saving the world from racism—they still looked to authorities (mystics for Bapu, doctors for the others) to tell them how and why they were feeling this way. Their distress took a form that was created in dialogue with others, a process that altered the path of their suffering and their identities too.

IN AN ESSAY on the nature of recovery, the psychologist Pat Deegan, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia when she was seventeen, criticized the messaging of a popular advertising campaign for antidepressants. In an ad that circulated in the late nineties, a smiling girl races up the stairs to greet her mother. “I got my Mommy back,” reads a note in crayon. Deegan challenges the idea that, after the disruption of mental illness, people can slip back into their former identities. “For those of us who have struggled for years, the restitution storyline does not hold true,” she writes. In another essay, comparing herself to a friend who was paralyzed from the neck down, Deegan writes, “Recovery does not refer to an end product or result. It does not mean that the paralyzed man and I were ‘cured.’ In fact, our recovery is marked by an ever-deepening acceptance of our limitations.”

A more relatable comparison might be something like Cheerios versus Froot Loops. As Kellogg’s is practically giddy to point out, its Froot Loops cereal has about the same number of calories as its rival’s health-hallowed Cheerios. So why does Toucan Sam get singled out? (I was deposed as an expert witness in a case against sugary cereal manufacturers, so I heard these arguments firsthand.) Yes, the two cereals may have similar calories, but that doesn’t take into account all the appetite-stimulating effects of concentrated sugar.16 In an experiment in which children were alternately offered high-versus lower-sugar cereals, had they eaten more Cheerios than Froot Loops, they could have gotten more calories, but the opposite happened. On average, the kids poured and ate 77 percent more of the sugary cereal. So even with comparable calorie counts, sugary cereals may end up nearly doubling caloric intake.17 In a lab, a calorie is a calorie, but in life, far from it. Even if you eat and absorb the same number of calories, a calorie may still not be a calorie. As you’ll learn, the same number of calories eaten at a different time of the day, in a different meal distribution, or after different amounts of sleep can translate into different amounts of body fat. It’s not only what we eat but how and when. And the same number on the scale can mean different things on different diets or in different contexts. You could be losing weight but actually gaining body fat if your body sheds water and muscle mass. So it’s not just about calories in versus calories out, eating less, and moving more. We’ll see an illustration of this later, with a famous series of studies on prisoners in Vermont that showed that, depending on what the researchers fed them, it could take up to one hundred thousand more calories to create the same amount of weight gain. So you’ll learn how they effectively made one hundred thousand calories disappear. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

There’s even debate in the scientific literature as to whether changes in physical activity had “any role whatsoever” in the obesity epidemic.42 The increase in caloric intake per person is more than enough to explain the U.S.43 and global44 epidemics of obesity. In fact, if anything, the level of physical activity over the last few decades has gone up slightly in both Europe and North America, rather than declined.45 Ironically, this bump may be a result of the extra energy it takes to haul around our heavier bodies, making changes in energy expenditure a consequence of the obesity problem rather than the cause.

To date, about one hundred genetic markers have been linked to obesity, but when you put all of them together, they account for less than 3 percent of the difference in body mass index between people.52 The “fat gene” you may have heard about (called FTO, short for “FaT mass and Obesity associated”) is the gene most strongly linked to obesity,53 but it explains less than 1 percent of the difference between people (a mere 0.34 percent).54 FTO codes for a brain protein that appears to affect your appetite.55 Are you one of the billion people on Earth who carry a full complement of FTO susceptibility genes?56 It doesn’t really matter, because this only appears to result in a difference in intake of a few hundred extra calories a year,57 while what it took to lead to the obesity epidemic is more like a few hundred calories a day.58 FTO is the gene so far known to have the most effect on excessive weight gain,59 but the chances of accurately predicting obesity risk based on FTO status are only slightly better than flipping a coin.

If you lock up two dozen folks in a research study and feed each the exact same number of excess calories, they all gain weight, but some gain more than others. In one study, overfeeding the same thousand calories a day, six days a week for one hundred days caused weight gains ranging from about nine pounds to twenty-nine pounds. Some people are just more genetically susceptible. The twenty-four people in the study were twelve sets of identical twins, and the variation in weight gain between each of them was about a third less than between the unrelated subjects.112 A similar study with weight loss from exercise found a similar result.113 So, yes, genetics play a role, but that just means some people have to work harder than others

Who do you think most determines the birth weight of a test-tube baby—the donor mom who provided all the DNA, or the surrogate mom who provided the intrauterine environment? When it was put to the test, the womb won. Incredibly, a baby born to an obese surrogate mother with a skinny biological mom may harbor a greater risk of becoming obese than a baby from a big biological mom born to a slim surrogate.

The most compelling data come from comparing obesity rates in siblings born to the same mother before and after she had bariatric (weight loss) surgery.116 Compared to their brothers and sisters born after the surgery, those born when the mom weighed about one hundred pounds more had higher rates of inflammation and metabolic derangements, and, most critically, three times the risk of severe obesity (affecting 35 percent of those born before the weight loss, compared to 11 percent born after). The researchers concluded that “these data emphasize how critical it is to prevent obesity and treat it effectively to prevent further transmission to future generations.”

The researchers concluded that “these data emphasize how critical it is to prevent obesity and treat it effectively to prevent further transmission to future generations.”117 But wait. Mom had the same DNA before and after the surgery. She passed down the same genes. How could her weight during pregnancy affect the weight destiny of her children any differently? We finally figured out the mechanism by which this can happen: epigenetics. Epigenetics, which literally means above genetics, layers an extra level of information on top of the DNA sequence that can both be affected by our surroundings and potentially passed on to our children.118 This is thought to account for the “developmental programming”119 (also known as metabolic imprinting120) that can occur in the womb depending on the weight of the mother, or even the grandmother. Since all the eggs in an infant daughter’s ovaries are already preformed before birth,121 a mother’s weight status during pregnancy could potentially affect the obesity risk of her grandchildren too.122 Either way, you can imagine how this could result in a vicious intergenerational cycle where obesity begets obesity.

What happened in the 1970s was a revolution in the food industry. In the 1960s, most food was prepared and cooked in the home. The average housewife spent hours a day cooking and cleaning up after meals (the husband averaged nine minutes).131 But then a profound transformation took place. Technological advances in food preservation and packaging enabled manufacturers to mass prepare and distribute food for ready consumption. The metamorphosis has been compared to what had happened a century before in the Industrial Revolution with the mass production and supply of manufactured goods. This time, though, it was the mass production and supply of food. Using new preservatives, artificial flavors, and techniques such as deep freezing and vacuum packing, food companies could take advantage of economies of scale132 to mass-produce ready-made, durable, palatable edibles that offer an enormous commercial advantage over fresh and perishable foods.133 And the packaged food sector is now a multitrillion-dollar industry.

After one of the farm bills, corn and soy were subsidized below the cost of production for cheap animal fodder, effectively handing the poultry and pork industries around $10 billion each.150 That’s not chicken feed. Or rather, it is! This is changing what we eat. Thanks in part to subsidies, meats, sweets, eggs, oils, dairy, and soda were all getting relatively cheaper as the obesity epidemic took off (compared to the overall consumer food price index), whereas the relative cost of fresh fruits and vegetables doubled.151 This may help explain why, during about the same period, the percentage of Americans getting five servings of fruits and vegetables a day dropped from 42 percent to 26 percent.152 Why not subsidize produce instead? Because that’s not where the money is.

In addition to the $10 billion or so spent on advertising each year, the food industry spends around another $20 billion on other forms of marketing, such as trade shows, incentives, consumer promotions, and supermarket “slotting fees,”183 which are the purchasing of shelf space from grocery stores by food and beverage companies to prominently display their most profitable products. The practice is evidently known as cliffing, because companies are forced to bid against each other for eye-level shelf placement, with the loser being pushed “over the cliff.”184 With slotting fees up to $20,000 per item, per retailer, and per city,185 you can imagine what kinds of products get the special treatment.

The downward trend in longevity is expected to accelerate as the current, younger generation—who started out heavier from a younger age than ever before—matures into adulthood. If the obesity epidemic continues unchecked, current trends signal a potential “looming social and economic catastrophe.”369 In the coming decades, some predict we may lose two to five years—or more—of life expectancy in the United States. To put that into perspective, a miracle cure for all forms of cancer would only add three and a half years to the average American life span.370 In other words, reversing the obesity epidemic might save more lives than curing cancer.

Happiness is not experiencing something else; it’s continually experiencing what you already have in new and different ways.

Being that our only frame of reference at any given time is what’s happened in the past, we actually have no means to determine what would make us truly happy, as opposed to just feeling “saved” from whatever we disliked about our past experiences. In understanding this, they open themselves up to any experience that their life evolves toward, knowing there are equal parts good and bad in anything.

Most people surveyed mistakenly thought that over-the-counter appetite suppressants, herbal products, and weight-loss supplements had to be approved for safety by a government agency like the FDA before being sold to the public—or at least include some kind of warning on the label about potential side effects. Nearly half even thought they had to demonstrate some sort of effectiveness.704 None of that is true.

Given the lack of government oversight, there’s no guarantee that what’s on the label is even inside the bottle. FDA inspectors have found that 70 percent of supplement manufacturers violated so-called Good Manufacturing Practices, which are considered the minimum quality standards,711 such as basic sanitation and ingredient identification. Not 7 percent, but 70 percent.

The problem isn’t limited just to fly-by-night phonies in some dark corner of the internet. The New York State Attorney General commissioned DNA testing of seventy-eight bottles of commercial herbal supplements sold by Walgreens, Walmart, Target, and GNC. Four out of five bottles didn’t contain any of the herbs listed on their labels. Instead, capsules were often stuffed with little more than cheap fillers like powdered rice “and houseplants.”

Researchers in Denver tested every weight-loss supplement they could find within a ten-mile radius and alarmingly found a third were adulterated with banned ingredients, and 90 percent contained “discouraged-use” components.719 The most common illegal adulterant of weight-loss supplements is sibutramine, the Meridia drug that was yanked off the market back in 2010 for heart attack and stroke risk,720 and is now blamed for cases of slimming supplement–induced psychosis.

You can see how self-licensing can translate into other lifestyle arenas. Other studies have shown that those given placebo pills they believed to be dietary supplements not only expressed less desire to subsequently engage in exercise but followed through by walking about a third less. Compared to those who were told the pills were placebos, misled participants were also more likely to choose a buffet over a “healthful, organic meal.”

But why not sell apples instead of Apple Jacks or oranges instead of Orange Crush? To quote from Slick Willie Sutton’s apocryphal answer to why he robbed banks: “That’s where the money is.” The reason some of the unhealthiest foods are marketed is one of simple economics: Real food goes bad.751 Fruits and vegetables are perishable. What shareholders want is a snack cake that lasts for weeks on the shelf. On top of that, real food doesn’t have brand names. Why would a broccoli grower put an ad on TV when you’d just as likely buy their competitor’s broccoli? The system is simply not set up to reward the sale of health-promoting food. And finally, real food costs money to grow. Shareholders don’t want dirt—they want dirt-cheap commodities such as corn syrup, preferably discounted by taxpayer subsidies, that they can then mix with carbonated water and sell for a few bucks a bottle.

Excise taxes on cigarettes have been cited as the single most effective weapon in slashing smoking rates.758 A twenty-five-cents-per-pack tax to help deal with some of the societal costs of smoking was tied to as much as a 9 percent decrease in smoking rates.759 The World Health Organization has estimated that a 70 percent global increase in the price of cigarettes could prevent up to a quarter of all tobacco-related deaths worldwide.760 Extending taxes on alcohol and tobacco to foodstuffs was proposed by none other than Adam Smith in his 1776 Wealth of Nations: “Sugar, rum, and tobacco, are commodities which are nowhere necessaries of life, which are become objects of almost universal consumption, and which are, therefore, extremely proper subjects of taxation.”761 People have the right to smoke, drink, and eat fattening foods, the logic goes, but perhaps they should help defray some of the publicly funded medical costs that result from their unhealthy habits.762 A penny-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages could bring in more than a billion dollars a year in states like Texas and California.763 A 10 percent tax on fattening foods on a national level could yield half a trillion dollars over ten years.764 Even if such a tax were combined with a subsidy that lowered the cost of fruits and vegetables by 10 percent, it would be expected to net hundreds of billions of dollars. But would it change anyone’s eating habits? Just a small price differential of about 10 percent between unleaded and leaded gas was able to shift the entire auto industry away from lead.765 What we want to know now is whether such a price difference could also shift Americans to apples from apple pie. A systematic review of the available evidence suggests that dietary financial incentives and disincentives do work. The cheaper we make fruits and vegetables, the more people said they’d buy, and the more we tax unhealthy foods, the lower their consumption drops.766 Based on this kind of modeling, a tax on saturated fat (found mostly in fatty meat, dairy, and junk) could potentially save thousands of lives a year.

research subjects were randomized to view a Big Mac advertisement with or without the preventive health message For your health, eat at least five fruits and vegetables per day. (After all, wouldn’t it be great if McDonald’s were forced to advertise healthy food?) The subjects then filled out a general questionnaire and, before they left, were allowed to choose one of two McDonald’s coupons as a reward for their participation: a free sundae or a free bag of fruit.790 Guess who was more likely to pick the fruit? Only one in three who had just seen the straight burger advertisement, the one without the preventive health message, chose the fruit over the sundae, but that number fell to only about one in six among those who had been prompted to eat healthier.791 Isn’t that wild? The absence of the healthy message doubled the number of people choosing the healthy snack. The health message made things worse. This may be the remedy-messaging boomerang effect in action.

“It is not just Big Tobacco anymore,” declared the director-general of the World Health Organization.801 “Public health must also contend with Big Food, Big Soda, and Big Alcohol. All of these industries fear regulation, and protect themselves by using the same tactics … front groups, lobbies, promises of self-regulation, lawsuits, and industry-funded research that confuses the evidence and keeps the public in doubt.” It’s like that infamous tobacco industry memo that read: “Doubt is our product since it’s the best means of competing with the body of fact that exists in the mind of the general public.”802 The tobacco industry didn’t have to convince the public that smoking was healthy to get people to keep consuming its products. It just needed to establish a controversy: Some science says it’s bad, some says it’s not so bad. Conflicting messages in nutrition cause people to become so frustrated and confused they may just throw their hands up in the air and eat whatever’s put in front of them, which is exactly what the industry wants. No purveyor of unhealthy products wants the public to know the truth. An extraordinary example of this is the tobacco industry’s 1967 response to the Fairness Doctrine. A court ruled that TV and radio stations had to run one health ad about smoking for every four tobacco ads they ran. Rather than risk the public being informed—even on a one-to-four basis—the tobacco companies withdrew all their own advertising from television.803 They knew they couldn’t compete with the truth. They needed to keep the public in the dark.

“Signpost labeling” offers easy-to-understand traffic-light symbols alerting shoppers to the salt, sugar, and saturated fat content of products right on the front of every package.806 When it’s been tried, investment analysts at Citibank concluded, “The magnitude of the sales impacts is such that we are left with the inescapable conclusion that the increased prevalence of front-of-pack signposts may lead to marked changes in consumer buying habits.” It works so well that green, yellow, and red traffic-light labeling poses “dire consequences” for certain food categories.807 No wonder the food industry fought it fiercely, spending more than a billion dollars to defeat it in Europe, an amount that’s ten times more than the drug industry lobby spends annually in the United States.

Just as one might divine the significance of front-of-pack signpost labeling from the ferocity of the industry response, one could probably gauge the futility of calorie labeling by the ease at which such regulations have been passed. McDonald’s voluntarily started doing it nationally in 2012809 after a labeling mandate in New York City was found to have no overall effect on consumer behavior.810 Studies suggest such voluntary labeling could boost “perceptions of the restaurant’s concern for customers’ well-being,”811 while not stopping any Big Mac attacks.

The same thing happens when you offer people the choice of a bacon cheeseburger, a chicken sandwich, or a veggie burger. In a “No Healthy Option” scenario where people were offered the bacon cheeseburger, a chicken sandwich, or a fish sandwich, 17 percent chose the burger. When the fish sandwich was replaced with a veggie burger, however, the bacon cheeseburger preference more than doubled, up to 37 percent. How can just seeing a healthy option push people to make unhealthier choices? The title given to the paper describing these series of experiments is “Vicarious Goal Fulfillment: When the Mere Presence of a Healthy Option Leads to an Ironically Indulgent Decision.” The thinking is that just by seeing the salad or plant-based option, people make the mental note to choose that the next time, thereby giving them the excuse to indulge now. Remember the self-licensing effect, where people making progress toward a goal rationalize making decisions that undermine it? These experiments suggest that even merely considering making progress can have a similar licensing effect.813

Compared to the “No Healthy Option” scenario of chocolate-covered Oreos, regular Oreos, or golden Oreos, adding a “lower-calorie” Oreo option doubled the likelihood study participants would go straight for the most indulgent chocolate-covered option.

Once you’ve already strayed from your goals, why not go all the way?

The industry has since revised the “healthier dietary choices” criteria to allow only cereals that are below 38 percent sugar by weight.831 Even if they’re “only” one-third sugar, that means kids effectively are eating at least one spoonful of sugar in every three spoonfuls of cereal.832 I wouldn’t call that a healthy dietary choice. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) tried stepping it back in 1978, but industry poured in millions to fight it, and, with enough campaign contributions, Congress essentially threatened to yank the entire agency’s funding if it continued to pursue industry regulations.833 This demonstrated to a former CDC nutrition director “just how powerful market forces are compared to those that can be mobilized on behalf of children.”834 The political post-traumatic stress induced by the industry backlash delayed further federal efforts to rein in food marketing aimed at children for decades.

major conclusion of congressional hearings on fraud in the diet industry was that the entire sector was characterized by deceptive and misleading advertising, rife with puffed-up promises.900 In an analysis of hundreds of weight-loss advertisements, the FTC found that most ads made at least one claim that was very likely to be false or, at the very least, lacking adequate substantiation. Some were “grossly exaggerated,” “obviously false claims” that were simply not “physiologically possible,” like the product that guaranteed weight-loss efficacy comparable to “running a 20 mile marathon while you sleep.” And it appears to be getting even worse. Compared to a similar analysis of ads in the 1990s, the FTC noted a “downward spiral to deception in weight-loss advertising.”901 The FTC has recovered millions for conned consumers, but a law journal article described the agency’s actions as a “mere slap on the wrist” for an industry worth billions.

Throughout most of human history, however, inflammation was considered to be a good thing. When you get a splinter in your finger and it gets red, hot, painful, and swollen, that’s inflammation. It’s your body’s natural reaction to tissue damage or irritation. So if the point of inflammation is to trigger the healing process, not a disease process, what’s going on? That splinter reaction is an example of acute inflammation, a short-term, localized, specific response to infection or injury aimed at resolving a problem. In contrast, chronic inflammation, also called metabolic inflammation, or meta-inflammation for short, is persistent, systemic, and nonspecific, and it appears to perpetuate disease.930 It has a low-grade, smoldering quality—it’s not as though we’re red, hot, pained, and swollen all over. Simple blood tests, however, can detect abnormally high levels of inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein so that we can gauge our level of chronic inflammation. C-reactive protein levels in the blood are ideally under 1 mg/L,931 but in the presence of an infection, they can jump to 100 mg/L or more within hours.932 Now that we have highly sensitive C-reactive protein blood tests that can measure levels to a fraction of a point, the medical community has realized that walking around with baseline levels of even just 2 or 3 mg/L appears to set us up for increased risk of catastrophes like heart attacks and strokes.933 Having a C-reactive protein level under 1 mg/L denotes low risk, yet the levels of most middle-aged Americans exceed this,934 suggesting most suffer from chronic inflammation.

When put to the test, the calorie labeling on packaged foods was sometimes found to be so inaccurate that one investigation discovered up to a quarter of foods sampled failed to even comply with the 20 percent error allowed by the FDA.983

Just like your hypothalamus regulates body temperature by causing you to shiver when you get too cold and sweat when you get too hot, it also regulates body fat, causing you to eat more when you get too thin and less when you get too fat. It’s our “satiety center,” carefully controlling our appetites so we eat just the right amount over time and don’t gain or lose too much weight. But how exactly does the hypothalamus know how fat we are? Our fat cells release a hormone called leptin, from the Greek leptos for thin. The more fat we have on our bodies, the higher the levels of leptin in our blood. The hypothalamus uses leptin levels as our fat thermostat and downregulates our appetites when leptin levels get too high. “Experimental Obesity in Man,” a classic set of prisoner experiments published in the 1970s, showed how difficult it was to perturb this system of appetite regulation when it is working properly. Lean inmates in a Vermont prison were fed up to ten thousand calories a day in closely supervised meals with a goal of increasing their weights by up to 25 percent.985 This turned out to be surprisingly difficult. Most started dreading breakfast and sometimes involuntarily threw it up.986 Most powered through, though, and achieved the excess weight target. But as soon as they were released from the experiment, they tended to rapidly shed all those extra pounds and get back to around their original weights.987 This all makes sense based on what we now know about the leptin-hypothalamus fat thermostat. All that extra body fat led to extra leptin production, and in response, their hypothalami profoundly depressed their appetites until they got back down to baseline. When their fat volumes dropped back to normal, their leptin levels presumably dropped back to normal, too, and so it seems their hypothalami made their normal appetites return. How, then, do people become obese—and what does it have to do with inflammation? Inflammatory Brain Damage as a Cause of Obesity People can gain weight—and keep it on—when there is damage to this leptin-hypothalamus circuit. Extreme cases of so-called hypothalamic obesity date back to 1840, when an “uncommonly obese” woman was found on autopsy to have a tumor near her hypothalamus.988 Anything that harms the hypothalamus can cause obesity—head trauma, aneurysms, brain surgery.989 Once the damage occurs and that feedback loop is broken, the hypothalamus can no longer respond adequately to rising leptin warning signals. As a result, people can develop out-of-control appetites, even to the point of having to be locked up for stealing food.990

Their hypothalami would never get the too-much-fat signal to turn down their appetites—and indeed, such children eat constantly, tragically becoming so obese some can hardly walk, sometimes exceeding one hundred pounds by age four.991 But inject these children with leptin, and the weight comes off. The first child this was tried on was a nine-year-old girl weighing more than two hundred pounds. Within days of the leptin administration, there was a marked change in her eating behavior. For the first time in her life, she felt satiated eating the same quantity of food as her siblings, in effect proving the importance of leptin in appetite regulation.992 Want to guess how eager the drug industry was to start injecting people with leptin as the next new miracle weight-loss cure? But remember: Obese individuals are already awash with excess leptin secreted by all their extra fat. The problem is that the leptin just isn’t working.

But remember: Obese individuals are already awash with excess leptin secreted by all their extra fat. The problem is that the leptin just isn’t working. An analogy can be made with diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, blood sugars get too high because people can’t make enough insulin. Inject them with insulin, and their blood sugars come right back down. That’s like the kids with the rare leptin birth defect: Their body weights get too high because they can’t make enough leptin, but if you inject them with leptin, their body weights come right back down. In contrast, type 2 diabetics can make enough insulin, but the target tissues are resistant to the effects of the insulin. There’s already enough insulin in the body—in fact, there’s often excess insulin, as the pancreas tries to pump out more to overcome the resistance. The body just isn’t responding properly. Similarly, obesity is thought to be caused by leptin resistance. Overweight individuals produce enough leptin—excess leptin, actually—but the target tissue, the hypothalamus, is resistant to its effects. So what can we do about it? Well, what do we do to treat insulin resistance? Broadly, there are two ways to approach type 2 diabetes: The traditional medical model tries to overwhelm the system by injecting even more insulin, whereas the lifestyle medicine model instead treats the cause, attempting to reverse the insulin resistance itself so the body’s own natural feedback loop can start working again. Similarly with obesity, attempts have been made to try to overwhelm the system by injecting even more leptin, but why not instead treat the underlying problem by reversing the leptin resistance?993 Interestingly, insulin resistance and leptin resistance may share a common cause: lipotoxicity, from the Greek lipos, meaning animal fat. Lipotoxicity is caused by eating a diet high in calories with too much saturated fat and can result in inflammation.994
